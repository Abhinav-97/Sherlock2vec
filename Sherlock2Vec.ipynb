       "'\\ufeff\\r\\nA SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA\\r\\nI\\r\\nTo Sherlock Holmes she is always _the_ woman. I have seldom heard\\r\\nhim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\\r\\npredominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion\\r\\nakin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly,\\r\\nwere abhorrent to his cold, precise, but admirably balanced mind. He\\r\\nwas, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that\\r\\nthe world has seen; but, as a lover, he would have placed himself in a\\r\\nfalse position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe\\r\\nand a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent\\r\\nfor drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the\\r\\ntrained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and\\r\\nfinely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which\\r\\nmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive\\r\\ninstrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not\\r\\nbe more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And\\r\\nyet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene\\r\\nAdler, of dubious and questionable memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\\r\\nfrom each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\\r\\ninterests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\\r\\nof his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention;\\r\\nwhile Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole\\r\\nBohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among\\r\\nhis old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and\\r\\nambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his\\r\\nown keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study\\r\\nof crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers\\r\\nof observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\\r\\nmysteries, which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.\\r\\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his\\r\\nsummons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing\\r\\nup of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,\\r\\nand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and\\r\\nsuccessfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of\\r\\nhis activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of\\r\\nthe daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night—it was on the 20th of March, 1888—I was returning from a\\r\\njourney to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\\r\\nmy way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\\r\\ndoor, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and\\r\\nwith the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a\\r\\nkeen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his\\r\\nextraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\\r\\nlooked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\\r\\nagainst the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\\r\\nhead sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\\r\\nknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\\r\\nstory. He was at work again. He had arisen out of his drug-created\\r\\ndreams, and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the\\r\\nbell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part\\r\\nmy own.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\\r\\nto see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\\r\\nme to an arm-chair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\\r\\nspirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the\\r\\nfire, and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put\\r\\non seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven!” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\\r\\nfancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\\r\\nthat you intended to go into harness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, how do you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\\r\\nyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\\r\\nservant girl?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\\r\\nbeen burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had\\r\\na country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess; but, as I\\r\\nhave changed my clothes, I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\\r\\nJane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice; but there,\\r\\nagain, I fail to see how you work it out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the\\r\\ninside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the\\r\\nleather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have\\r\\nbeen caused by some one who has very carelessly scraped round the\\r\\nedges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you\\r\\nsee, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and\\r\\nthat you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\\r\\nLondon slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms\\r\\nsmelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his\\r\\nright forefinger, and a bulge on the side of his top-hat to show where\\r\\nhe has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\\r\\npronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\\r\\nprocess of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\\r\\n“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\\r\\ncould easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\\r\\nreasoning I am baffled, until you explain your process. And yet I\\r\\nbelieve that my eyes are as good as yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\\r\\ndown into an arm-chair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\\r\\ndistinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\\r\\nwhich lead up from the hall to this room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frequently.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How often?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, some hundreds of times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how many are there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How many? I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\\r\\nmy point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\\r\\nboth seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these\\r\\nlittle problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\\r\\nof my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\\r\\nover a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open\\r\\nupon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,”\\r\\nit said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the\\r\\nvery deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses\\r\\nof Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\\r\\nmatters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\\r\\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\\r\\nchamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\\r\\nwear a mask.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\\r\\nmeans?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has\\r\\ndata. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\\r\\ntheories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\\r\\nwritten.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\\r\\nendeavoring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\\r\\nbe bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\\r\\nstiff.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\\r\\npaper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so, and saw a large _E_ with a small _g_, a _P_, and a large _G_\\r\\nwith a small _t_ woven into the texture of the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. The _G_ with the small _t_ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\\r\\nwhich is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\\r\\nour ‘Co.’ _P_, of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the _Eg_. Let us\\r\\nglance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\\r\\nfrom his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\\r\\nGerman-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\\r\\nas being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\\r\\nglass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\\r\\nthat?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\\r\\nfrom his cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\\r\\npeculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have\\r\\nfrom all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have\\r\\nwritten that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It\\r\\nonly remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German\\r\\nwho writes upon Bohemian paper, and prefers wearing a mask to showing\\r\\nhis face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\\r\\ndoubts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\\r\\nwheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\\r\\nwhistled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\\r\\nthe window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\\r\\nand fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\\r\\nis nothing else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit, doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\\r\\nAnd this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But your client—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\\r\\nSit down in that arm-chair, doctor, and give us your best attention.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\\r\\npassage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\\r\\nauthoritative tap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come in!” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “A MAN ENTERED”]\\r\\n\\r\\nA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\\r\\nin height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\\r\\nwith a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\\r\\ntaste. Heavy bands of Astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\\r\\nfronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which\\r\\nwas thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-colored silk, and\\r\\nsecured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\\r\\nberyl. Boots which extended half-way up his calves, and which were\\r\\ntrimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\\r\\nbarbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\\r\\ncarried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\\r\\npart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\\r\\nmask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\\r\\nwas still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\\r\\nhe appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging\\r\\nlip, and a long, straight chin, suggestive of resolution pushed to the\\r\\nlength of obstinacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had my note?” he asked, with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\\r\\nmarked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from\\r\\none to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr.\\r\\nWatson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom\\r\\nhave I the honor to address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.\\r\\nI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honor\\r\\nand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme\\r\\nimportance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into\\r\\nmy chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this\\r\\ngentleman anything which you may say to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he,\\r\\n“by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years, at the end of\\r\\nthat time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too\\r\\nmuch to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon\\r\\nEuropean history.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I promise,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august\\r\\nperson who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may\\r\\nconfess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is\\r\\nnot exactly my own.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was aware of it,” said Holmes, dryly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has\\r\\nto be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and\\r\\nseriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak\\r\\nplainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary\\r\\nkings of Bohemia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in\\r\\nhis arm-chair and closing his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,\\r\\nlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as\\r\\nthe most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes\\r\\nslowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I\\r\\nshould be better able to advise you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in\\r\\nuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore\\r\\nthe mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,”\\r\\nhe cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before\\r\\nI was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von\\r\\nOrmstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of\\r\\nBohemia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once\\r\\nmore and passing his hand over his high, white forehead, “you can\\r\\nunderstand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own\\r\\nperson. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to\\r\\nan agent without putting myself in his power. I have come _incognito_\\r\\nfrom Prague for the purpose of consulting you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy\\r\\nvisit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known\\r\\nadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kindly look her up in my index, doctor,” murmured Holmes, without\\r\\nopening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing\\r\\nall paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult\\r\\nto name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish\\r\\ninformation. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between\\r\\nthat of a Hebrew Rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a\\r\\nmonograph upon the deep-sea fishes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year\\r\\n1858. Contralto—hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of\\r\\nWarsaw—Yes! Retired from operatic stage—ha! Living in London—quite\\r\\nso! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young\\r\\nperson, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of\\r\\ngetting those letters back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. But how—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was there a secret marriage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No legal papers or certificates?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should\\r\\nproduce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to\\r\\nprove their authenticity?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is the writing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pooh, pooh! Forgery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My private note-paper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stolen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My own seal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Imitated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My photograph.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bought.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were both in the photograph.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an\\r\\nindiscretion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was mad—insane.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have compromised yourself seriously.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must be recovered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have tried and failed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She will not sell.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stolen, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her\\r\\nhouse. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has\\r\\nbeen waylaid. There has been no result.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No sign of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely none.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But a very serious one to me,” returned the King, reproachfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To ruin me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am about to be married.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I have heard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of\\r\\nScandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is\\r\\nherself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct\\r\\nwould bring the matter to an end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Irene Adler?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that\\r\\nshe will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She\\r\\nhas the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most\\r\\nresolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are\\r\\nno lengths to which she would not go—none.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are sure that she has not sent it yet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the\\r\\nbetrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, then, we have three days yet,” said Holmes, with a yawn. “That is\\r\\nvery fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into\\r\\njust at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the\\r\\npresent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. You will find me at the Langham, under the name of the\\r\\nCount Von Kramm.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, as to money?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have _carte blanche_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to\\r\\nhave that photograph.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And for present expenses?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid\\r\\nit on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it\\r\\nto him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And mademoiselle’s address?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the\\r\\nphotograph a cabinet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have\\r\\nsome good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the\\r\\nwheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be\\r\\ngood enough to call to-morrow afternoon, at three o’clock, I should\\r\\nlike to chat this little matter over with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nII\\r\\n\\r\\nAt three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not\\r\\nyet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house\\r\\nshortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the\\r\\nfire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he\\r\\nmight be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though\\r\\nit was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which\\r\\nwere associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded,\\r\\nstill, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client\\r\\ngave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the\\r\\ninvestigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his\\r\\nmasterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which\\r\\nmade it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the\\r\\nquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable\\r\\nmysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very\\r\\npossibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking\\r\\ngroom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and\\r\\ndisreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to\\r\\nmy friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look\\r\\nthree times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod\\r\\nhe vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes\\r\\ntweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his\\r\\npockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire, and laughed\\r\\nheartily for some minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked; and laughed again until\\r\\nhe was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed\\r\\nmy morning, or what I ended by doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and\\r\\nperhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however.\\r\\nI left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning, in the\\r\\ncharacter of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and\\r\\nfreemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all\\r\\nthat there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a _bijou_\\r\\nvilla, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to\\r\\nthe road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on\\r\\nthe right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,\\r\\nand those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could\\r\\nopen. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window\\r\\ncould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it\\r\\nand examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting\\r\\nanything else of interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I then lounged down the street, and found, as I expected, that there\\r\\nwas a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent\\r\\nthe ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and I received in\\r\\nexchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,\\r\\nand as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say\\r\\nnothing of half a dozen other people in the neighborhood in whom I was\\r\\nnot in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to\\r\\nlisten to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what of Irene Adler?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She\\r\\nis the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the\\r\\nSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives\\r\\nout at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom\\r\\ngoes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male\\r\\nvisitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing,\\r\\nnever calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey\\r\\nNorton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a\\r\\nconfidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews,\\r\\nand knew all about him. When I had listened to all that they had to\\r\\ntell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to\\r\\nthink over my plan of campaign.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the\\r\\nmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation\\r\\nbetween them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she\\r\\nhis client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had\\r\\nprobably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter,\\r\\nit was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I\\r\\nshould continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the\\r\\ngentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it\\r\\nwidened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these\\r\\ndetails, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are\\r\\nto understand the situation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am following you closely,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was still balancing the matter in my mind, when a hansom cab drove\\r\\nup to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably\\r\\nhandsome man, dark, aquiline, and mustached—evidently the man of whom\\r\\nI had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman\\r\\nto wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of\\r\\na man who was thoroughly at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of\\r\\nhim in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking\\r\\nexcitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently\\r\\nhe emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up\\r\\nto the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it\\r\\nearnestly. ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross &\\r\\nHankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the church of St. Monica in the\\r\\nEdgware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do\\r\\nwell to follow them, when up the lane came a neat little landau, the\\r\\ncoachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear,\\r\\nwhile all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It\\r\\nhadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I\\r\\nonly caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman,\\r\\nwith a face that a man might die for.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if\\r\\nyou reach it in twenty minutes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether\\r\\nI should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau,\\r\\nwhen a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a\\r\\nshabby fare; but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of\\r\\nSt. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty\\r\\nminutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was\\r\\nclear enough what was in the wind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others\\r\\nwere there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses\\r\\nwere in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried\\r\\ninto the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had\\r\\nfollowed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with\\r\\nthem. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I\\r\\nlounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a\\r\\nchurch. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to\\r\\nme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God!” he cried. “You’ll do. Come! Come!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was half-dragged up to the altar, and, before I knew where I was, I\\r\\nfound myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and\\r\\nvouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting\\r\\nin the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton,\\r\\nbachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman\\r\\nthanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the\\r\\nclergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position\\r\\nin which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of\\r\\nit that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been\\r\\nsome informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely\\r\\nrefused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky\\r\\nappearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the\\r\\nstreets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I\\r\\nmean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the\\r\\npair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt\\r\\nand energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they\\r\\nseparated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I\\r\\nshall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said, as she left\\r\\nhim. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I\\r\\nwent off to make my own arrangements.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which are?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I\\r\\nhave been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still\\r\\nthis evening. By the way, doctor, I shall want your co-operation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be delighted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mind breaking the law?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor running a chance of arrest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not in a good cause.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, the cause is excellent!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I am your man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was sure that I might rely on you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what is it you wish?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to\\r\\nyou. Now,” he said, as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our\\r\\nlandlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not\\r\\nmuch time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene\\r\\nof action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at\\r\\nseven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur.\\r\\nThere is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere,\\r\\ncome what may. You understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am to be neutral?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small\\r\\nunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed\\r\\ninto the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window\\r\\nwill open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And when I raise my hand—so—you will throw into the room what I give\\r\\nyou to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You\\r\\nquite follow me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Entirely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped\\r\\nroll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket,\\r\\nfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is\\r\\nconfined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken\\r\\nup by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the\\r\\nstreet, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made\\r\\nmyself clear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and, at\\r\\nthe signal, to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and\\r\\nto wait you at the corner of the street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you may entirely rely on me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare\\r\\nfor the new role I have to play.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe disappeared into his bedroom, and returned in a few minutes in the\\r\\ncharacter of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His\\r\\nbroad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic\\r\\nsmile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such\\r\\nas Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that\\r\\nHolmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul\\r\\nseemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a\\r\\nfine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a\\r\\nspecialist in crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still\\r\\nwanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine\\r\\nAvenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as\\r\\nwe paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming\\r\\nof its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’s succinct description, but the locality appeared to\\r\\nbe less private that I expected. On the contrary, for a small street\\r\\nin a quiet neighborhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a\\r\\ngroup of shabbily-dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a\\r\\nscissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a\\r\\nnurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and\\r\\ndown with cigars in their mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the\\r\\nhouse, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes\\r\\na double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse\\r\\nto its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming\\r\\nto the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find\\r\\nthe photograph?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where, indeed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet\\r\\nsize. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows\\r\\nthat the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two\\r\\nattempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that\\r\\nshe does not carry it about with her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am\\r\\ninclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they\\r\\nlike to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to any one\\r\\nelse? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell\\r\\nwhat indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a\\r\\nbusiness man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within\\r\\na few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be\\r\\nin her own house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it has twice been burgled.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pshaw! They did not know how to look.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how will you look?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not look.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will get her to show me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But she will refuse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her\\r\\ncarriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the\\r\\ncurve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to\\r\\nthe door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at\\r\\nthe corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a\\r\\ncopper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with\\r\\nthe same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by\\r\\nthe two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the\\r\\nscissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was\\r\\nstruck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,\\r\\nwas the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who\\r\\nstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes\\r\\ndashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her\\r\\nhe gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely\\r\\ndown his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one\\r\\ndirection and the loungers in the other, while a number of better\\r\\ndressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,\\r\\ncrowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene\\r\\nAdler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she\\r\\nstood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of\\r\\nthe hall, looking back into the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is dead,” cried several voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone\\r\\nbefore you can get him to hospital.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s\\r\\npurse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a\\r\\nrough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa.\\r\\nThis way, please!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the\\r\\nprincipal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post\\r\\nby the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been\\r\\ndrawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not\\r\\nknow whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part\\r\\nhe was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of\\r\\nmyself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom\\r\\nI was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited\\r\\nupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to\\r\\nHolmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me.\\r\\nI hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster.\\r\\nAfter all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing\\r\\nher from injuring another.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who\\r\\nis in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At\\r\\nthe same instant I saw him raise his hand, and at the signal I tossed\\r\\nmy rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner\\r\\nout of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and\\r\\nill—gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids—joined in a general shriek\\r\\nof “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at\\r\\nthe open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment\\r\\nlater the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false\\r\\nalarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner\\r\\nof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm\\r\\nin mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly\\r\\nand in silence for some few minutes, until we had turned down one of\\r\\nthe quiet streets which lead towards the Edgware Road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did it very nicely, doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been\\r\\nbetter. It is all right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have the photograph?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know where it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you find out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She showed me, as I told you that she would.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am still in the dark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was\\r\\nperfectly simple. You, of course, saw that every one in the street was\\r\\nan accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guessed as much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the\\r\\npalm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my\\r\\nface, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That also I could fathom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could\\r\\nshe do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I\\r\\nsuspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined\\r\\nto see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were\\r\\ncompelled to open the window, and you had your chance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did that help you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire,\\r\\nher instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It\\r\\nis a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken\\r\\nadvantage of it. In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it\\r\\nwas of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married\\r\\nwoman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.\\r\\nNow it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house\\r\\nmore precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to\\r\\nsecure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting\\r\\nwere enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The\\r\\nphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right\\r\\nbell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as\\r\\nshe half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she\\r\\nreplaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have\\r\\nnot seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the\\r\\nhouse. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;\\r\\nbut the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it\\r\\nseemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King\\r\\nto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown\\r\\ninto the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that\\r\\nwhen she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be\\r\\na satisfaction to His Majesty to regain it with his own hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And when will you call?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a\\r\\nclear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a\\r\\ncomplete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without\\r\\ndelay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had reached Baker Street, and had stopped at the door. He was\\r\\nsearching his pockets for the key, when some one passing said:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting\\r\\nappeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly-lit\\r\\nstreet. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIII\\r\\n\\r\\nI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast\\r\\nand coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either\\r\\nshoulder, and looking eagerly into his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have hopes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have hopes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must have a cab.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, my brougham is waiting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then that will simplify matters.” We descended, and started off once\\r\\nmore for Briony Lodge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Married! When?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But to whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To an English lawyer named Norton.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But she could not love him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am in hopes that she does.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why in hopes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If\\r\\nthe lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does\\r\\nnot love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with\\r\\nyour Majesty’s plan.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true. And yet—Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What\\r\\na queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which\\r\\nwas not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon\\r\\nthe steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the\\r\\nbrougham.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a\\r\\nquestioning and rather startled gaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left\\r\\nthis morning with her husband by the 5.15 train from Charing Cross for\\r\\nthe Continent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and\\r\\nsurprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never to return.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the papers?” asked the King, hoarsely. “All is lost.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the\\r\\ndrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was\\r\\nscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open\\r\\ndrawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.\\r\\nHolmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter,\\r\\nand, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The\\r\\nphotograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was\\r\\nsuperscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My\\r\\nfriend tore it open, and we all three read it together. It was dated at\\r\\nmidnight of the preceding night, and ran in this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—You really did it very\\r\\n  well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of\\r\\n  fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had\\r\\n  betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against\\r\\n  you months ago. I had been told that, if the King employed an\\r\\n  agent, it would certainly be you. And your address had been\\r\\n  given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you\\r\\n  wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard\\r\\n  to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you\\r\\n  know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume\\r\\n  is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom\\r\\n  which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran\\r\\n  up-stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and\\r\\n  came down just as you departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was\\r\\n  really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock\\r\\n  Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and\\r\\n  started for the Temple to see my husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by\\r\\n  so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty\\r\\n  when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may\\r\\n  rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he.\\r\\n  The King may do what he will without hinderance from one whom\\r\\n  he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself,\\r\\n  and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any\\r\\n  steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph\\r\\n  which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock\\r\\n  Holmes, very truly yours,      IRENE NORTON, _née_ ADLER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a woman—oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we\\r\\nhad all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and\\r\\nresolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not\\r\\na pity that she was not on my level?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very\\r\\ndifferent level to your Majesty,” said Holmes, coldly. “I am sorry\\r\\nthat I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more\\r\\nsuccessful conclusion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more\\r\\nsuccessful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as\\r\\nsafe as if it were in the fire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward\\r\\nyou. This ring—” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and\\r\\nheld it out upon the palm of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,”\\r\\nsaid Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have but to name it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This photograph!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe King stared at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter.\\r\\nI have the honor to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and,\\r\\nturning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched\\r\\nout to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of\\r\\nBohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by\\r\\na woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but\\r\\nI have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler,\\r\\nor when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honorable\\r\\ntitle of _the_ woman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure II\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the autumn\\r\\nof last year, and found him in deep conversation with a very stout,\\r\\nflorid-faced, elderly gentleman, with fiery red hair. With an apology\\r\\nfor my intrusion, I was about to withdraw, when Holmes pulled me\\r\\nabruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,” he\\r\\nsaid, cordially.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid that you were engaged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I am. Very much so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I can wait in the next room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and helper\\r\\nin many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that he will\\r\\nbe of the utmost use to me in yours also.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stout gentleman half-rose from his chair and gave a bob of\\r\\ngreeting, with a quick, little, questioning glance from his small,\\r\\nfat-encircled eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Try the settee,” said Holmes, relapsing into his arm-chair and putting\\r\\nhis finger-tips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. “I\\r\\nknow, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and\\r\\noutside the conventions and humdrum routine of every-day life. You have\\r\\nshown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to\\r\\nchronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish\\r\\nso many of my own little adventures.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me,” I\\r\\nobserved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we went\\r\\ninto the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that\\r\\nfor strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to\\r\\nlife itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the\\r\\nimagination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view,\\r\\nfor otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you, until your\\r\\nreason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr.\\r\\nJabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,\\r\\nand to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular\\r\\nwhich I have listened to for some time. You have heard me remark that\\r\\nthe strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with\\r\\nthe larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where\\r\\nthere is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.\\r\\nAs far as I have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the\\r\\npresent case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events\\r\\nis certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.\\r\\nPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence\\r\\nyour narrative. I ask you, not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has\\r\\nnot heard the opening part, but also because the peculiar nature of the\\r\\nstory makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips.\\r\\nAs a rule, when I have heard some slight indication of the course of\\r\\nevents, I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar\\r\\ncases which occur to my memory. In the present instance I am forced to\\r\\nadmit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some\\r\\nlittle pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside\\r\\npocket of his great-coat. As he glanced down the advertisement column,\\r\\nwith his head thrust forward, and the paper flattened out upon his\\r\\nknee, I took a good look at the man, and endeavored, after the fashion\\r\\nof my companion, to read the indications which might be presented by\\r\\nhis dress or appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore\\r\\nevery mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese,\\r\\npompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy gray shepherd’s check trousers,\\r\\na not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab\\r\\nwaistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of\\r\\nmetal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown\\r\\novercoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.\\r\\nAltogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man\\r\\nsave his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and\\r\\ndiscontent upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’s quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his\\r\\nhead with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. “Beyond the\\r\\nobvious facts that he has at some time done manual labor, that he takes\\r\\nsnuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he\\r\\nhas done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing\\r\\nelse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the\\r\\npaper, but his eyes upon my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\nhe asked. “How did you know, for example, that I did manual labor. It’s\\r\\nas true as gospel, for I began as a ship’s carpenter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than\\r\\nyour left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I won’t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,\\r\\nespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use\\r\\nan arc-and-compass breastpin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five\\r\\ninches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you\\r\\nrest it upon the desk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, but China?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist\\r\\ncould only have been done in China. I have made a small study of tattoo\\r\\nmarks, and have even contributed to the literature of the subject.\\r\\nThat trick of staining the fishes’ scales of a delicate pink is quite\\r\\npeculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from\\r\\nyour watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. “Well, I never!” said he. “I thought\\r\\nat first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was\\r\\nnothing in it, after all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I begin to think, Watson,” said Holmes, “that I make a mistake in\\r\\nexplaining. ‘Omne ignotum pro magnifico,’ you know, and my poor little\\r\\nreputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can\\r\\nyou not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have got it now,” he answered, with his thick, red finger\\r\\nplanted half-way down the column. “Here it is. This is what began it\\r\\nall. You just read it for yourself, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the paper from him, and read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the\\r\\n  late Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pa., U.S.A., there is now\\r\\n  another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League\\r\\n  to a salary of £4 a week for purely nominal services. All\\r\\n  red-headed men who are sound in body and mind, and above\\r\\n  the age of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on\\r\\n  Monday, at eleven o’clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of\\r\\n  the League, 7 Pope’s Court, Fleet Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth does this mean?” I ejaculated, after I had twice read\\r\\nover the extraordinary announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled, and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in\\r\\nhigh spirits. “It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?” said\\r\\nhe. “And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch, and tell us all about\\r\\nyourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had\\r\\nupon your fortunes. You will first make a note, doctor, of the paper\\r\\nand the date.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is _The Morning Chronicle_, of April 27, 1890. Just two months ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,”\\r\\nsaid Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; “I have a small pawnbroker’s\\r\\nbusiness at Coburg Square, near the city. It’s not a very large affair,\\r\\nand of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I\\r\\nused to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; and I\\r\\nwould have a job to pay him, but that he is willing to come for half\\r\\nwages, so as to learn the business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the name of this obliging youth?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he’s not such a youth, either. It’s\\r\\nhard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes;\\r\\nand I know very well that he could better himself, and earn twice what\\r\\nI am able to give him. But, after all, if he is satisfied, why should I\\r\\nput ideas in his head?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an _employé_ who\\r\\ncomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience among\\r\\nemployers in this age. I don’t know that your assistant is not as\\r\\nremarkable as your advertisement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he has his faults, too,” said Mr. Wilson. “Never was such a fellow\\r\\nfor photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be\\r\\nimproving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit\\r\\ninto its hole to develope his pictures. That is his main fault; but, on\\r\\nthe whole, he’s a good worker. There’s no vice in him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is still with you, I presume?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking,\\r\\nand keeps the place clean—that’s all I have in the house, for I am a\\r\\nwidower, and never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, the three\\r\\nof us; and we keep a roof over our heads, and pay our debts, if we do\\r\\nnothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he\\r\\ncame down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very\\r\\npaper in his hand, and he says:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why that?’ I asks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why,’ says he, ‘here’s another vacancy on the League of the\\r\\nRed-headed Men. It’s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets\\r\\nit, and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,\\r\\nso that the trustees are at their wits’ end what to do with the money.\\r\\nIf my hair would only change color, here’s a nice little crib all ready\\r\\nfor me to step into.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what is it, then?’ I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very\\r\\nstay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having\\r\\nto go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the\\r\\ndoor-mat. In that way I didn’t know much of what was going on outside,\\r\\nand I was always glad of a bit of news.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?’ he asked,\\r\\nwith his eyes open.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Never.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the\\r\\nvacancies.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And what are they worth?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it\\r\\nneed not interfere very much with one’s other occupations.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the\\r\\nbusiness has not been over-good for some years, and an extra couple of\\r\\nhundred would have been very handy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me all about it,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said he, showing me the advertisement, ‘you can see for\\r\\nyourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address\\r\\nwhere you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, the\\r\\nLeague was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who\\r\\nwas very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, and he had a\\r\\ngreat sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found\\r\\nthat he had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with\\r\\ninstructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to\\r\\nmen whose hair is of that color. From all I hear it is splendid pay,\\r\\nand very little to do.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But,’ said I, ‘there would be millions of red-headed men who would\\r\\napply.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Not so many as you might think,’ he answered. ‘You see it is really\\r\\nconfined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had started from\\r\\nLondon when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.\\r\\nThen, again, I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is\\r\\nlight red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery\\r\\nred. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in;\\r\\nbut perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of\\r\\nthe way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my\\r\\nhair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that, if\\r\\nthere was to be any competition in the matter, I stood as good a chance\\r\\nas any man that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so\\r\\nmuch about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered\\r\\nhim to put up the shutters for the day, and to come right away with me.\\r\\nHe was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up, and\\r\\nstarted off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From\\r\\nnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his\\r\\nhair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. Fleet\\r\\nStreet was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope’s Court looked\\r\\nlike a coster’s orange barrow. I should not have thought there were\\r\\nso many in the whole country as were brought together by that single\\r\\nadvertisement. Every shade of color they were—straw, lemon, orange,\\r\\nbrick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were\\r\\nnot many who had the real vivid flame-colored tint. When I saw how many\\r\\nwere waiting, I would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would\\r\\nnot hear of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and\\r\\npulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up to\\r\\nthe steps which led to the office. There was a double stream upon the\\r\\nstair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we\\r\\nwedged in as well as we could, and soon found ourselves in the office.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your experience has been a most entertaining one,” remarked Holmes, as\\r\\nhis client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.\\r\\n“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a\\r\\ndeal table, behind which sat a small man, with a head that was even\\r\\nredder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came\\r\\nup, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would\\r\\ndisqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy\\r\\nmatter, after all. However, when our turn came, the little man was much\\r\\nmore favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door\\r\\nas we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,’ said my assistant, ‘and he is willing to\\r\\nfill a vacancy in the League.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And he is admirably suited for it,’ the other answered. ‘He has every\\r\\nrequirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so fine.’ He\\r\\ntook a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair\\r\\nuntil I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my\\r\\nhand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It would be injustice to hesitate,’ said he. ‘You will, however, I am\\r\\nsure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.’ With that he seized\\r\\nmy hair in both his hands, and tugged until I yelled with the pain.\\r\\n‘There is water in your eyes,’ said he, as he released me. ‘I perceive\\r\\nthat all is as it should be. But we have to be careful, for we have\\r\\ntwice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. I could tell you tales\\r\\nof cobbler’s wax which would disgust you with human nature.’ He stepped\\r\\nover to the window, and shouted through it at the top of his voice that\\r\\nthe vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,\\r\\nand the folk all trooped away in different directions, until there was\\r\\nnot a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My name,’ said he, ‘is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of the\\r\\npensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a\\r\\nmarried man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I answered that I had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His face fell immediately.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Dear me!’ he said, gravely, ‘that is very serious indeed! I am sorry\\r\\nto hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the propagation\\r\\nand spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is\\r\\nexceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not\\r\\nto have the vacancy after all; but, after thinking it over for a few\\r\\nminutes, he said that it would be all right.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘In the case of another,’ said he, ‘the objection might be fatal, but\\r\\nwe must stretch a point in favor of a man with such a head of hair as\\r\\nyours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!’ said Vincent Spaulding. ‘I\\r\\nshall be able to look after that for you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What would be the hours?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ten to two.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now a pawnbroker’s business is mostly done of an evening, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nespecially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just before pay-day;\\r\\nso it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.\\r\\nBesides, I knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see\\r\\nto anything that turned up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That would suit me very well,’ said I. ‘And the pay?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Is £4 a week.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And the work?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Is purely nominal.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What do you call purely nominal?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the\\r\\nwhole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever.\\r\\nThe will is very clear upon that point. You don’t comply with the\\r\\nconditions if you budge from the office during that time.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It’s only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,’ said\\r\\nI.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No excuse will avail,’ said Mr. Duncan Ross, ‘neither sickness nor\\r\\nbusiness nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your\\r\\nbillet.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And the work?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Is to copy out the “Encyclopædia Britannica.” There is the first\\r\\nvolume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and\\r\\nblotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be ready\\r\\nto-morrow?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly,’ I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you once\\r\\nmore on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to\\r\\ngain.’ He bowed me out of the room, and I went home with my assistant,\\r\\nhardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good\\r\\nfortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in\\r\\nlow spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole\\r\\naffair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might\\r\\nbe I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that any one\\r\\ncould make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing\\r\\nanything so simple as copying out the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’\\r\\nVincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I\\r\\nhad reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning\\r\\nI determined to have a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle\\r\\nof ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I\\r\\nstarted off for Pope’s Court.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.\\r\\nThe table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to\\r\\nsee that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon the letter A, and\\r\\nthen he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all\\r\\nwas right with me. At two o’clock he bade me good-day, complimented me\\r\\nupon the amount that I had written, and locked the door of the office\\r\\nafter me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the manager\\r\\ncame in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week’s work.\\r\\nIt was the same next week, and the same the week after. Every morning\\r\\nI was there at ten, and every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr.\\r\\nDuncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after\\r\\na time, he did not come in at all. Still, of course, I never dared to\\r\\nleave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come,\\r\\nand the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would\\r\\nnot risk the loss of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about Abbots and\\r\\nArchery and Armor and Architecture and Attica, and hoped with diligence\\r\\nthat I might get on to the B’s before very long. It cost me something\\r\\nin foolscap, and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings.\\r\\nAnd then suddenly the whole business came to an end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To an end?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual\\r\\nat ten o’clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square\\r\\nof card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. Here\\r\\nit is, and you can read for yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of\\r\\nnote-paper. It read in this fashion:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE\\r\\n   IS\\r\\n   DISSOLVED.\\r\\n   _October 9, 1890._”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful\\r\\nface behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely\\r\\novertopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar\\r\\nof laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot see that there is anything very funny,” cried our client,\\r\\nflushing up to the roots of his flaming head. “If you can do nothing\\r\\nbetter than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he\\r\\nhad half risen. “I really wouldn’t miss your case for the world. It is\\r\\nmost refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying\\r\\nso, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you\\r\\ntake when you found the card upon the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called at\\r\\nthe offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.\\r\\nFinally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the\\r\\nground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me what had become of\\r\\nthe Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard of any such\\r\\nbody. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that the\\r\\nname was new to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘the gentleman at No. 4.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What, the red-headed man?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh,’ said he, ‘his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor, and\\r\\nwas using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises\\r\\nwere ready. He moved out yesterday.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where could I find him?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17 King\\r\\nEdward Street, near St. Paul’s.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a\\r\\nmanufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of\\r\\neither Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what did you do then?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my\\r\\nassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that\\r\\nif I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough,\\r\\nMr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,\\r\\nas I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk\\r\\nwho were in need of it, I came right away to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you did very wisely,” said Holmes. “Your case is an exceedingly\\r\\nremarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it. From what you\\r\\nhave told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from\\r\\nit than might at first sight appear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Grave enough!” said Mr. Jabez Wilson. “Why, I have lost four pound a\\r\\nweek.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As far as you are personally concerned,” remarked Holmes, “I do not\\r\\nsee that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. On\\r\\nthe contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some £30, to say\\r\\nnothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject\\r\\nwhich comes under the letter A. You have lost nothing by them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are, and what\\r\\ntheir object was in playing this prank—if it was a prank—upon me. It\\r\\nwas a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty\\r\\npounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall endeavor to clear up these points for you. And, first, one\\r\\nor two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who first called\\r\\nyour attention to the advertisement—how long had he been with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About a month then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did he come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In answer to an advertisement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was he the only applicant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I had a dozen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you pick him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because he was handy, and would come cheap.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At half-wages, in fact.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,\\r\\nthough he’s not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon his\\r\\nforehead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. “I thought as\\r\\nmuch,” said he. “Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for\\r\\nearrings?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. He told me that a gypsy had done it for him when he was a\\r\\nlad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum!” said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. “He is still with\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, sir; I have only just left him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And has your business been attended to in your absence?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing to complain of, sir. There’s never very much to do of a\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon\\r\\nthe subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is Saturday, and I\\r\\nhope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson,” said Holmes, when our visitor had left us, “what do you\\r\\nmake of it all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I make nothing of it,” I answered, frankly. “It is a most mysterious\\r\\nbusiness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As a rule,” said Holmes, “the more bizarre a thing is the less\\r\\nmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes\\r\\nwhich are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most\\r\\ndifficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you going to do, then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To smoke,” he answered. “It is quite a three-pipe problem, and I beg\\r\\nthat you won’t speak to me for fifty minutes.” He curled himself up\\r\\nin his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and\\r\\nthere he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out\\r\\nlike the bill of some strange bird. I had come to the conclusion that\\r\\nhe had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly\\r\\nsprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his\\r\\nmind, and put his pipe down upon the mantel-piece.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sarasate plays at the St. James’s Hall this afternoon,” he remarked.\\r\\n“What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few\\r\\nhours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the city first, and\\r\\nwe can have some lunch on the way. I observe that there is a good deal\\r\\nof German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than\\r\\nItalian or French. It is introspective, and I want to introspect. Come\\r\\nalong!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short walk\\r\\ntook us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular story which we\\r\\nhad listened to in the morning. It was a pokey, little, shabby-genteel\\r\\nplace, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out\\r\\ninto a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and\\r\\na few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a\\r\\nsmoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown\\r\\nboard with “JABEZ WILSON” in white letters, upon a corner\\r\\nhouse, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his\\r\\nbusiness. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one\\r\\nside, and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between\\r\\npuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again\\r\\nto the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally he returned\\r\\nto the pawnbroker’s, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement\\r\\nwith his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked.\\r\\nIt was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow,\\r\\nwho asked him to step in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes, “I only wished to ask you how you would go\\r\\nfrom here to the Strand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Third right, fourth left,” answered the assistant, promptly, closing\\r\\nthe door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Smart fellow, that,” observed Holmes, as we walked away. “He is, in my\\r\\njudgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring I am not\\r\\nsure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known something of him\\r\\nbefore.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Evidently,” said I, “Mr. Wilson’s assistant counts for a good deal in\\r\\nthis mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your\\r\\nway merely in order that you might see him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The knees of his trousers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what did you see?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I expected to see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you beat the pavement?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are\\r\\nspies in an enemy’s country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg Square.\\r\\nLet us now explore the parts which lie behind it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner\\r\\nfrom the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to\\r\\nit as the front of a picture does to the back. It was one of the main\\r\\narteries which convey the traffic of the city to the north and west.\\r\\nThe roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing\\r\\nin a double tide inward and outward, while the foot-paths were black\\r\\nwith the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. It was difficult to realize\\r\\nas we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises\\r\\nthat they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant\\r\\nsquare which we had just quitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, standing at the corner, and glancing along\\r\\nthe line, “I should like just to remember the order of the houses here.\\r\\nIt is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London. There is\\r\\nMortimer’s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the Coburg\\r\\nbranch of the City and Suburban Bank, the Vegetarian Restaurant, and\\r\\nMcFarlane’s carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to the\\r\\nother block. And now, doctor, we’ve done our work, so it’s time we had\\r\\nsome play. A sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,\\r\\nwhere all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no\\r\\nred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a\\r\\nvery capable performer, but a composer of no ordinary merit. All the\\r\\nafternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,\\r\\ngently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his\\r\\ngently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those\\r\\nof Holmes, the sleuth-hound, Holmes the relentless, keen-witted,\\r\\nready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his\\r\\nsingular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and\\r\\nhis extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often\\r\\nthought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which\\r\\noccasionally predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from\\r\\nextreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was never\\r\\nso truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in\\r\\nhis arm-chair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.\\r\\nThen it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,\\r\\nand that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of\\r\\nintuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would\\r\\nlook askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other\\r\\nmortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enrapt in the music at St.\\r\\nJames’s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom\\r\\nhe had set himself to hunt down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You want to go home, no doubt, doctor,” he remarked, as we emerged.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it would be as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This\\r\\nbusiness at Coburg Square is serious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why serious?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to\\r\\nbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday\\r\\nrather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At what time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ten will be early enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be at Baker Street at ten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well. And, I say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so\\r\\nkindly put your army revolver in your pocket.” He waved his hand,\\r\\nturned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “ALL AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS”]\\r\\n\\r\\nI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbors, but I was always\\r\\noppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had\\r\\nseen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not\\r\\nonly what had happened, but what was about to happen, while to me the\\r\\nwhole business was still confused and grotesque. As I drove home to\\r\\nmy house in Kensington I thought over it all, from the extraordinary\\r\\nstory of the red-headed copier of the “Encyclopædia” down to the visit\\r\\nto Saxe-Coburg Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted\\r\\nfrom me. What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?\\r\\nWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from Holmes\\r\\nthat this smooth-faced pawnbroker’s assistant was a formidable man—a\\r\\nman who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it\\r\\nup in despair, and set the matter aside until night should bring an\\r\\nexplanation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way\\r\\nacross the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two\\r\\nhansoms were standing at the door, and, as I entered the passage, I\\r\\nheard the sound of voices from above. On entering his room I found\\r\\nHolmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognized\\r\\nas Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long,\\r\\nthin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable\\r\\nfrock-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! our party is complete,” said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket,\\r\\nand taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. “Watson, I think\\r\\nyou know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr.\\r\\nMerryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night’s adventure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see,” said Jones, in his\\r\\nconsequential way. “Our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a\\r\\nchase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,”\\r\\nobserved Mr. Merryweather, gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir,” said the\\r\\npolice agent, loftily. “He has his own little methods, which are, if he\\r\\nwon’t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,\\r\\nbut he has the makings of a detective in him. It is not too much to\\r\\nsay that once or twice, as in that business of the Sholto murder and\\r\\nthe Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official\\r\\nforce.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right,” said the stranger,\\r\\nwith deference. “Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is the\\r\\nfirst Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I have not had my\\r\\nrubber.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think you will find,” said Sherlock Holmes, “that you will play for\\r\\na higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play\\r\\nwill be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, the stake will be\\r\\nsome £30,000; and for you, Jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish\\r\\nto lay your hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He’s a young man,\\r\\nMr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and I would\\r\\nrather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He’s a\\r\\nremarkable man, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke,\\r\\nand he himself has been to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as\\r\\nhis fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never\\r\\nknow where to find the man himself. He’ll crack a crib in Scotland one\\r\\nweek, and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.\\r\\nI’ve been on his track for years, and have never set eyes on him yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. I’ve\\r\\nhad one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I agree with\\r\\nyou that he is at the head of his profession. It is past ten, however,\\r\\nand quite time that we started. If you two will take the first hansom,\\r\\nWatson and I will follow in the second.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive,\\r\\nand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the\\r\\nafternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets\\r\\nuntil we emerged into Farringdon Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are close there now,” my friend remarked. “This fellow Merryweather\\r\\nis a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. I thought\\r\\nit as well to have Jones with us also. He is not a bad fellow, though\\r\\nan absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He\\r\\nis as brave as a bull-dog, and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his\\r\\nclaws upon any one. Here we are, and they are waiting for us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found\\r\\nourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and, following\\r\\nthe guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage\\r\\nand through a side door, which he opened for us. Within there was a\\r\\nsmall corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was\\r\\nopened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated\\r\\nat another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a\\r\\nlantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and\\r\\nso, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was\\r\\npiled all round with crates and massive boxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not very vulnerable from above,” Holmes remarked, as he held\\r\\nup the lantern and gazed about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor from below,” said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon the\\r\\nflags which lined the floor. “Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!” he\\r\\nremarked, looking up in surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must really ask you to be a little more quiet,” said Holmes,\\r\\nseverely. “You have already imperilled the whole success of our\\r\\nexpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down\\r\\nupon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very\\r\\ninjured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees\\r\\nupon the floor, and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to\\r\\nexamine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few seconds sufficed\\r\\nto satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again, and put his glass in\\r\\nhis pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have at least an hour before us,” he remarked; “for they can\\r\\nhardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.\\r\\nThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work\\r\\nthe longer time they will have for their escape. We are at present,\\r\\ndoctor—as no doubt you have divined—in the cellar of the city branch\\r\\nof one of the principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is the chairman\\r\\nof directors, and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the\\r\\nmore daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in\\r\\nthis cellar at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is our French gold,” whispered the director. “We have had several\\r\\nwarnings that an attempt might be made upon it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your French gold?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources, and\\r\\nborrowed, for that purpose, 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France.\\r\\nIt has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the\\r\\nmoney, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which\\r\\nI sit contains 2000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our\\r\\nreserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a\\r\\nsingle branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the\\r\\nsubject.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which were very well justified,” observed Holmes. “And now it is time\\r\\nthat we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters\\r\\nwill come to a head. In the mean time, Mr. Merryweather, we must put\\r\\nthe screen over that dark lantern.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And sit in the dark?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I\\r\\nthought that, as we were a _partie carrée_, you might have your rubber\\r\\nafter all. But I see that the enemy’s preparations have gone so far\\r\\nthat we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must\\r\\nchoose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take\\r\\nthem at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.\\r\\nI shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind\\r\\nthose. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they\\r\\nfire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind\\r\\nwhich I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his\\r\\nlantern, and left us in pitch darkness—such an absolute darkness\\r\\nas I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained\\r\\nto assure us that the light was still there, ready to flash out at\\r\\na moment’s notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of\\r\\nexpectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden\\r\\ngloom, and in the cold, dank air of the vault.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have but one retreat,” whispered Holmes. “That is back through\\r\\nthe house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have done what I\\r\\nasked you, Jones?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent and\\r\\nwait.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an\\r\\nhour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have\\r\\nalmost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and\\r\\nstiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked\\r\\nup to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I\\r\\ncould not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could\\r\\ndistinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the\\r\\nthin, sighing note of the bank director. From my position I could look\\r\\nover the case in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught\\r\\nthe glint of a light.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then it\\r\\nlengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any\\r\\nwarning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared; a white,\\r\\nalmost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area\\r\\nof light. For a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,\\r\\nprotruded out of the floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it\\r\\nappeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which\\r\\nmarked a chink between the stones.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending, tearing\\r\\nsound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side, and\\r\\nleft a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a\\r\\nlantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which\\r\\nlooked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the\\r\\naperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee\\r\\nrested upon the edge. In another instant he stood at the side of the\\r\\nhole, and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like\\r\\nhimself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all clear,” he whispered. “Have you the chisel and the bags.\\r\\nGreat Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I’ll swing for it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.\\r\\nThe other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of rending cloth\\r\\nas Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed upon the barrel of a\\r\\nrevolver, but Holmes’s hunting crop came down on the man’s wrist, and\\r\\nthe pistol clinked upon the stone floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s no use, John Clay,” said Holmes, blandly. “You have no chance at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I see,” the other answered, with the utmost coolness. “I fancy that\\r\\nmy pal is all right, though I see you have got his coat-tails.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are three men waiting for him at the door,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I must\\r\\ncompliment you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I you,” Holmes answered. “Your red-headed idea was very new and\\r\\neffective.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see your pal again presently,” said Jones. “He’s quicker at\\r\\nclimbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the derbies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,” remarked\\r\\nour prisoner, as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. “You may not\\r\\nbe aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have the goodness, also,\\r\\nwhen you address me always to say ‘sir’ and ‘please.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said Jones, with a stare and a snigger. “Well, would you\\r\\nplease, sir, march up-stairs, where we can get a cab to carry your\\r\\nhighness to the police-station?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is better,” said John Clay, serenely. He made a sweeping bow to\\r\\nthe three of us, and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really Mr. Holmes,” said Mr. Merryweather, as we followed them from\\r\\nthe cellar, “I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.\\r\\nThere is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most\\r\\ncomplete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery\\r\\nthat have ever come within my experience.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.\\r\\nJohn Clay,” said Holmes. “I have been at some small expense over this\\r\\nmatter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am\\r\\namply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,\\r\\nand by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, Watson,” he explained, in the early hours of the morning,\\r\\nas we sat over a glass of whiskey-and-soda in Baker Street, “it was\\r\\nperfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this\\r\\nrather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the\\r\\ncopying of the ‘Encyclopædia,’ must be to get this not over-bright\\r\\npawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day. It was a\\r\\ncurious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to\\r\\nsuggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious\\r\\nmind by the color of his accomplice’s hair. The £4 a week was a lure\\r\\nwhich must draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for\\r\\nthousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary\\r\\noffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together\\r\\nthey manage to secure his absence every morning in the week. From\\r\\nthe time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages,\\r\\nit was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the\\r\\nsituation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how could you guess what the motive was?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a mere\\r\\nvulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man’s\\r\\nbusiness was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which\\r\\ncould account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure\\r\\nas they were at. It must, then, be something out of the house. What\\r\\ncould it be? I thought of the assistant’s fondness for photography,\\r\\nand his trick of vanishing into the cellar. The cellar! There was the\\r\\nend of this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious\\r\\nassistant, and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest\\r\\nand most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in the\\r\\ncellar—something which took many hours a day for months on end. What\\r\\ncould it be, once more? I could think of nothing save that he was\\r\\nrunning a tunnel to some other building.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I\\r\\nsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was\\r\\nascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.\\r\\nIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the\\r\\nassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had never\\r\\nset eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His\\r\\nknees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have remarked how\\r\\nworn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of those hours of\\r\\nburrowing. The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I\\r\\nwalked round the corner, saw that the City and Suburban Bank abutted on\\r\\nour friend’s premises, and felt that I had solved my problem. When you\\r\\ndrove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard, and upon the\\r\\nchairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?” I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they\\r\\ncared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words,\\r\\nthat they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they\\r\\nshould use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might\\r\\nbe removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it\\r\\nwould give them two days for their escape. For all these reasons I\\r\\nexpected them to come to-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You reasoned it out beautifully,” I exclaimed, in unfeigned\\r\\nadmiration. “It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It saved me from ennui,” he answered, yawning. “Alas! I already feel\\r\\nit closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape\\r\\nfrom the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do\\r\\nso.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you are a benefactor of the race,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders. “Well, perhaps, after all, it is of some\\r\\nlittle use,” he remarked. “‘L’homme c’est rien—l’oeuvre c’est\\r\\ntout,’ as Gustave Flaubert wrote to Georges Sand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure III\\r\\n\\r\\nA CASE OF IDENTITY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow,” said Sherlock Holmes, as we sat on either side\\r\\nof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, “life is infinitely\\r\\nstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would\\r\\nnot dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of\\r\\nexistence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over\\r\\nthis great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer\\r\\nthings which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings,\\r\\nthe cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through\\r\\ngenerations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all\\r\\nfiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale\\r\\nand unprofitable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet I am not convinced of it,” I answered. “The cases which come\\r\\nto light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.\\r\\nWe have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits,\\r\\nand yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor\\r\\nartistic.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a\\r\\nrealistic effect,” remarked Holmes. “This is wanting in the police\\r\\nreport, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the\\r\\nmagistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the\\r\\nvital essence of the whole matter. Depend upon it there is nothing so\\r\\nunnatural as the commonplace.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI smiled and shook my head. “I can quite understand you thinking so,”\\r\\nI said. “Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper\\r\\nto everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,\\r\\nyou are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. But\\r\\nhere”—I picked up the morning paper from the ground—“let us put it\\r\\nto a practical test. Here is the first heading upon which I come. ‘A\\r\\nhusband’s cruelty to his wife.’ There is half a column of print, but\\r\\nI know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me.\\r\\nThere is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow,\\r\\nthe bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of writers\\r\\ncould invent nothing more crude.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,”\\r\\nsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. “This\\r\\nis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged in\\r\\nclearing up some small points in connection with it. The husband was\\r\\na teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of\\r\\nwas that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by\\r\\ntaking out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you\\r\\nwill allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the\\r\\naverage story-teller. Take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge\\r\\nthat I have scored over you in your example.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the\\r\\ncentre of the lid. Its splendor was in such contrast to his homely ways\\r\\nand simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said he, “I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is\\r\\na little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance\\r\\nin the case of the Irene Adler papers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the ring?” I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which\\r\\nsparkled upon his finger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in which\\r\\nI served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to\\r\\nyou, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little\\r\\nproblems.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And have you any on hand just now?” I asked, with interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.\\r\\nThey are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed,\\r\\nI have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is\\r\\na field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and\\r\\neffect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are\\r\\napt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime, the more obvious, as\\r\\na rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate\\r\\nmatter which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing\\r\\nwhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however, that\\r\\nI may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this\\r\\nis one of my clients, or I am much mistaken.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had risen from his chair, and was standing between the parted\\r\\nblinds, gazing down into the dull, neutral-tinted London street.\\r\\nLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite there\\r\\nstood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large\\r\\ncurling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a\\r\\ncoquettish Duchess-of-Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under\\r\\nthis great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at\\r\\nour windows, while her body oscillated backward and forward, and her\\r\\nfingers fidgetted with her glove buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as\\r\\nof the swimmer who leaves the bank, she hurried across the road, and we\\r\\nheard the sharp clang of the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have seen those symptoms before,” said Holmes, throwing his\\r\\ncigarette into the fire. “Oscillation upon the pavement always means an\\r\\n_affaire de cœur_. She would like advice, but is not sure that the\\r\\nmatter is not too delicate for communication. And yet even here we may\\r\\ndiscriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no\\r\\nlonger oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we\\r\\nmay take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so\\r\\nmuch angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to\\r\\nresolve our doubts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered\\r\\nto announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind\\r\\nhis small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny\\r\\npilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for\\r\\nwhich he was remarkable, and having closed the door, and bowed her into\\r\\nan arm-chair, he looked her over in the minute, and yet abstracted\\r\\nfashion which was peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not find,” he said, “that with your short sight it is a little\\r\\ntrying to do so much type-writing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did at first,” she answered, “but now I know where the letters\\r\\nare without looking.” Then, suddenly realizing the full purport of\\r\\nhis words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and\\r\\nastonishment upon her broad, good-humored face. “You’ve heard about me,\\r\\nMr. Holmes,” she cried, “else how could you know all that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” said Holmes, laughing; “it is my business to know things.\\r\\nPerhaps I have trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why\\r\\nshould you come to consult me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege, whose\\r\\nhusband you found so easy when the police and every one had given him\\r\\nup for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I’m\\r\\nnot rich, but still I have a hundred a year in my own right, besides\\r\\nthe little that I make by the machine, and I would give it all to know\\r\\nwhat has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?” asked Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, with his finger-tips together, and his eyes to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary\\r\\nSutherland. “Yes, I did bang out of the house,” she said, “for it\\r\\nmade me angry to see the easy way in which Mr. Windibank—that is, my\\r\\nfather—took it all. He would not go to the police, and he would not\\r\\ngo to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing, and kept on saying\\r\\nthat there was no harm done, it made me mad, and I just on with my\\r\\nthings and came right away to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your father,” said Holmes, “your step-father, surely, since the name\\r\\nis different.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my step-father. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too,\\r\\nfor he is only five years and two months older than myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your mother is alive?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn’t best pleased, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nwhen she married again so soon after father’s death, and a man who was\\r\\nnearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in the\\r\\nTottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which\\r\\nmother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank\\r\\ncame he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a\\r\\ntraveller in wines. They got £4700 for the goodwill and interest, which\\r\\nwasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and\\r\\ninconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with\\r\\nthe greatest concentration of attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your own little income,” he asked, “does it come out of the business?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, sir. It is quite separate, and was left me by my Uncle Ned\\r\\nin Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4-1/2 per cent. Two\\r\\nthousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can only touch the\\r\\ninterest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You interest me extremely,” said Holmes. “And since you draw so large\\r\\na sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no\\r\\ndoubt travel a little, and indulge yourself in every way. I believe\\r\\nthat a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about £60.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “SHERLOCK HOLMES WELCOMED HER”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand\\r\\nthat as long as I live at home I don’t wish to be a burden to them, and\\r\\nso they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them. Of\\r\\ncourse, that is only just for the time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest\\r\\nevery quarter, and pays it over to mother, and I find that I can do\\r\\npretty well with what I earn at type-writing. It brings me twopence a\\r\\nsheet, and I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have made your position very clear to me,” said Holmes. “This is\\r\\nmy friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before\\r\\nmyself. Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr. Hosmer\\r\\nAngel.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA flush stole over Miss Sutherland’s face, and she picked nervously at\\r\\nthe fringe of her jacket. “I met him first at the gasfitters’ ball,”\\r\\nshe said. “They used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then\\r\\nafterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank\\r\\ndid not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would\\r\\nget quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat.\\r\\nBut this time I was set on going, and I would go; for what right had\\r\\nhe to prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all\\r\\nfather’s friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing fit\\r\\nto wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken\\r\\nout of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off\\r\\nto France upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and I,\\r\\nwith Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there I met Mr.\\r\\nHosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose,” said Holmes, “that when Mr. Windibank came back from\\r\\nFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a\\r\\nwoman, for she would have her way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. Then at the gasfitters’ ball you met, as I understand, a\\r\\ngentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we\\r\\nhad got home all safe, and after that we met him—that is to say, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back\\r\\nagain, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you know, father didn’t like anything of the sort. He wouldn’t\\r\\nhave any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman\\r\\nshould be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to\\r\\nmother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got\\r\\nmine yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer wrote\\r\\nand said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until\\r\\nhe had gone. We could write in the mean time, and he used to write\\r\\nevery day. I took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need\\r\\nfor father to know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that we\\r\\ntook. Hosmer—Mr. Angel—was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall\\r\\nStreet—and—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What office?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did he live, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He slept on the premises.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you don’t know his address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No—except that it was Leadenhall Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you address your letters, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the Leadenhall Street Post-office, to be left till called for. He\\r\\nsaid that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all\\r\\nthe other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to\\r\\ntype-write them, like he did his, but he wouldn’t have that, for he\\r\\nsaid that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they\\r\\nwere type-written he always felt that the machine had come between us.\\r\\nThat will just show you how fond he was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the\\r\\nlittle things that he would think of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was most suggestive,” said Holmes. “It has long been an axiom of\\r\\nmine that the little things are infinitely the most important. Can you\\r\\nremember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me in\\r\\nthe evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be\\r\\nconspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was\\r\\ngentle. He’d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he\\r\\ntold me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,\\r\\nwhispering fashion of speech. He was always well dressed, very neat and\\r\\nplain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted\\r\\nglasses against the glare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your step-father, returned\\r\\nto France?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again, and proposed that we should\\r\\nmarry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest, and made\\r\\nme swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever happened I\\r\\nwould always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me\\r\\nswear, and that it was a sign of his passion. Mother was all in his\\r\\nfavor from the first, and was even fonder of him than I was. Then, when\\r\\nthey talked of marrying within the week, I began to ask about father;\\r\\nbut they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him\\r\\nafterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. I\\r\\ndidn’t quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask\\r\\nhis leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn’t want\\r\\nto do anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the\\r\\ncompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on the\\r\\nvery morning of the wedding.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It missed him, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for the\\r\\nFriday. Was it to be in church?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour’s, near King’s\\r\\nCross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St. Pancras\\r\\nHotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us, he\\r\\nput us both into it, and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which\\r\\nhappened to be the only other cab in the street. We got to the church\\r\\nfirst, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step\\r\\nout, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and\\r\\nlooked, there was no one there! The cabman said that he could not\\r\\nimagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own\\r\\neyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard\\r\\nanything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated,” said\\r\\nHolmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all the\\r\\nmorning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true;\\r\\nand that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate\\r\\nus, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, and that he\\r\\nwould claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a\\r\\nwedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some\\r\\nunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not\\r\\nhave talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have no notion as to what it could have been?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One more question. How did your mother take the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your father? Did you tell him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and\\r\\nthat I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could any\\r\\none have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving\\r\\nme? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got\\r\\nmy money settled on him, there might be some reason; but Hosmer was\\r\\nvery independent about money, and never would look at a shilling of\\r\\nmine. And yet, what could have happened? And why could he not write?\\r\\nOh, it drives me half-mad to think of! and I can’t sleep a wink at\\r\\nnight.” She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff, and began to\\r\\nsob heavily into it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall glance into the case for you,” said Holmes, rising; “and I\\r\\nhave no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the weight\\r\\nof the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon\\r\\nit further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your\\r\\nmemory, as he has done from your life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you don’t think I’ll see him again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then what has happened to him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate\\r\\ndescription of him, and any letters of his which you can spare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I advertised for him in last Saturday’s _Chronicle_,” said she. “Here\\r\\nis the slip, and here are four letters from him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. And your address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Angel’s address you never had, I understand. Where is your\\r\\nfather’s place of business?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers of\\r\\nFenchurch Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will leave\\r\\nthe papers here, and remember the advice which I have given you. Let\\r\\nthe whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true\\r\\nto Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something\\r\\nnoble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.\\r\\nShe laid her little bundle of papers upon the table, and went her way,\\r\\nwith a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his finger-tips still\\r\\npressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze\\r\\ndirected upward to the ceiling. Then he took down from the rack the\\r\\nold and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having\\r\\nlit it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths\\r\\nspinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite an interesting study, that maiden,” he observed. “I found her\\r\\nmore interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather\\r\\na trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in\\r\\nAndover in ’77, and there was something of the sort at The Hague last\\r\\nyear. Old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which\\r\\nwere new to me. But the maiden herself was most instructive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to\\r\\nme,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not invisible, but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to look,\\r\\nand so you missed all that was important. I can never bring you to\\r\\nrealize the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,\\r\\nor the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you\\r\\ngather from that woman’s appearance? Describe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, she had a slate-colored, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a feather\\r\\nof a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it,\\r\\nand a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather\\r\\ndarker than coffee color, with a little purple plush at the neck and\\r\\nsleeves. Her gloves were grayish, and were worn through at the right\\r\\nforefinger. Her boots I didn’t observe. She had small, round, hanging\\r\\ngold ear-rings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do, in a\\r\\nvulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“’Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have\\r\\nreally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed\\r\\neverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you\\r\\nhave a quick eye for color. Never trust to general impressions, my boy,\\r\\nbut concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a\\r\\nwoman’s sleeve. In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee\\r\\nof the trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves,\\r\\nwhich is a most useful material for showing traces. The double line\\r\\na little above the wrist, where the type-writist presses against the\\r\\ntable, was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,\\r\\nleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side of it\\r\\nfarthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the broadest\\r\\npart, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and observing the dint\\r\\nof a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I ventured a remark upon\\r\\nshort sight and type-writing, which seemed to surprise her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It surprised me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, surely, it was very obvious. I was then much surprised and\\r\\ninterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she\\r\\nwas wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the\\r\\none having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one.\\r\\nOne was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the\\r\\nother at the first, third, and fifth. Now, when you see that a young\\r\\nlady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,\\r\\nhalf-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a\\r\\nhurry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what else?” I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my\\r\\nfriend’s incisive reasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home,\\r\\nbut after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was\\r\\ntorn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove\\r\\nand finger were stained with violet ink. She had written in a hurry,\\r\\nand dipped her pen too deep. It must have been this morning, or the\\r\\nmark would not remain clear upon the finger. All this is amusing,\\r\\nthough rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would\\r\\nyou mind reading me the advertised description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI held the little printed slip to the light. “Missing,” it said, “on\\r\\nthe morning of the 14th, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About 5 ft. 7\\r\\nin. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little\\r\\nbald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and mustache; tinted\\r\\nglasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in\\r\\nblack frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain,\\r\\nand gray Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over elastic-sided\\r\\nboots. Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street.\\r\\nAnybody bringing,” etc., etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do,” said Holmes. “As to the letters,” he continued,\\r\\nglancing over them, “they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clew\\r\\nin them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one\\r\\nremarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are type-written,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not only that, but the signature is type-written. Look at the neat\\r\\nlittle ‘Hosmer Angel’ at the bottom. There is a date, you see, but no\\r\\nsuperscription except Leadenhall Street, which is rather vague. The\\r\\npoint about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it\\r\\nconclusive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of what?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears\\r\\nupon the case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot say that I do, unless it were that he wished to be able to\\r\\ndeny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters, which\\r\\nshould settle the matter. One is to a firm in the city, the other is\\r\\nto the young lady’s step-father, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he\\r\\ncould meet us here at six o’clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well\\r\\nthat we should do business with the male relatives. And now, doctor, we\\r\\ncan do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put\\r\\nour little problem upon the shelf for the interim.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend’s subtle powers of\\r\\nreasoning, and extraordinary energy in action, that I felt that he must\\r\\nhave some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanor with which he\\r\\ntreated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom.\\r\\nOnce only had I known him to fail, in the case of the King of Bohemia\\r\\nand of the Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to the weird\\r\\nbusiness of the Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances\\r\\nconnected with the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange\\r\\ntangle indeed which he could not unravel.\\r\\n\\r\\nI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the\\r\\nconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that\\r\\nhe held in his hands all the clews which would lead up to the identity\\r\\nof the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.\\r\\n\\r\\nA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at\\r\\nthe time, and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the\\r\\nsufferer. It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself\\r\\nfree, and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street,\\r\\nhalf afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_\\r\\nof the little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half\\r\\nasleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his\\r\\narm-chair. A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the\\r\\npungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent\\r\\nhis day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, have you solved it?” I asked, as I entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, the mystery!” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon. There\\r\\nwas never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said yesterday, some\\r\\nof the details are of interest. The only drawback is that there is no\\r\\nlaw, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss\\r\\nSutherland?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet opened\\r\\nhis lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and a\\r\\ntap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is the girl’s step-father, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “He\\r\\nhas written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty\\r\\nyears of age, clean shaven, and sallow skinned, with a bland,\\r\\ninsinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating\\r\\ngray eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny\\r\\ntop hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the\\r\\nnearest chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank,” said Holmes. “I think that this\\r\\ntype-written letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with\\r\\nme for six o’clock?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my\\r\\nown master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you\\r\\nabout this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash\\r\\nlinen of the sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she\\r\\ncame, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have\\r\\nnoticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her\\r\\nmind on a point. Of course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not\\r\\nconnected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a\\r\\nfamily misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless\\r\\nexpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, quietly; “I have every reason to\\r\\nbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank gave a violent start, and dropped his gloves. “I am\\r\\ndelighted to hear it,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a curious thing,” remarked Holmes, “that a type-writer has\\r\\nreally quite as much individuality as a man’s handwriting. Unless they\\r\\nare quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some letters get\\r\\nmore worn than others, and some wear only on one side. Now, you remark\\r\\nin this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some\\r\\nlittle slurring over of the ‘e,’ and a slight defect in the tail of the\\r\\n‘r.’ There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more\\r\\nobvious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no\\r\\ndoubt it is a little worn,” our visitor answered, glancing keenly at\\r\\nHolmes with his bright little eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,\\r\\nMr. Windibank,” Holmes continued. “I think of writing another little\\r\\nmonograph some of these days on the type-writer and its relation to\\r\\ncrime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some little attention.\\r\\nI have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man.\\r\\nThey are all type-written. In each case, not only are the ‘e’s’ slurred\\r\\nand the ‘r’s’ tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my\\r\\nmagnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which I\\r\\nhave alluded are there as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair, and picked up his hat. “I cannot\\r\\nwaste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,” he said. “If\\r\\nyou can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the\\r\\ndoor. “I let you know, then, that I have caught him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! where?” shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips, and\\r\\nglancing about him like a rat in a trap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it won’t do—really it won’t,” said Holmes, suavely. “There is no\\r\\npossible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent,\\r\\nand it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible\\r\\nfor me to solve so simple a question. That’s right! Sit down, and let\\r\\nus talk it over.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face, and a glitter\\r\\nof moisture on his brow. “It—it’s not actionable,” he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,\\r\\nWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty\\r\\nway as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the course of\\r\\nevents, and you will contradict me if I go wrong.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his\\r\\nbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on\\r\\nthe corner of the mantel-piece, and, leaning back with his hands in his\\r\\npockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,”\\r\\nsaid he, “and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long\\r\\nas she lived with them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their\\r\\nposition, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference.\\r\\nIt was worth an effort to preserve it. The daughter was of a good,\\r\\namiable disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so\\r\\nthat it was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her\\r\\nlittle income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her\\r\\nmarriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what\\r\\ndoes her step-father do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of\\r\\nkeeping her at home, and forbidding her to seek the company of people\\r\\nof her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever.\\r\\nShe became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her\\r\\npositive intention of going to a certain ball. What does her clever\\r\\nstep-father do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head\\r\\nthan to his heart. With the connivance and assistance of his wife he\\r\\ndisguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked\\r\\nthe face with a mustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear\\r\\nvoice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the\\r\\ngirl’s short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off other\\r\\nlovers by making love himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “GLANCING ABOUT HIM LIKE A RAT IN A TRAP”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was only a joke at first,” groaned our visitor. “We never thought\\r\\nthat she would have been so carried away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very\\r\\ndecidedly carried away, and having quite made up her mind that her\\r\\nstep-father was in France, the suspicion of treachery never for\\r\\nan instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the gentleman’s\\r\\nattentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed\\r\\nadmiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was\\r\\nobvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go,\\r\\nif a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, and an\\r\\nengagement, which would finally secure the girl’s affections from\\r\\nturning towards any one else. But the deception could not be kept up\\r\\nforever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. The\\r\\nthing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a\\r\\ndramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the\\r\\nyoung lady’s mind, and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor\\r\\nfor some time to come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a\\r\\nTestament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something\\r\\nhappening on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished\\r\\nMiss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to\\r\\nhis fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen\\r\\nto another man. As far as the church door he brought her, and then, as\\r\\nhe could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick\\r\\nof stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler, and out at the other. I\\r\\nthink that that was the chain of events, Mr. Windibank!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had\\r\\nbeen talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his\\r\\npale face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “but if you are so\\r\\nvery sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are\\r\\nbreaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing actionable from\\r\\nthe first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself\\r\\nopen to an action for assault and illegal constraint.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The law cannot, as you say, touch you,” said Holmes, unlocking and\\r\\nthrowing open the door, “yet there never was a man who deserved\\r\\npunishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought\\r\\nto lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!” he continued, flushing\\r\\nup at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man’s face, “it is not\\r\\npart of my duties to my client, but here’s a hunting crop handy, and I\\r\\nthink I shall just treat myself to—” He took two swift steps to the\\r\\nwhip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps\\r\\nupon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we\\r\\ncould see Mr. James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the\\r\\nroad.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a cold-blooded scoundrel!” said Holmes, laughing, as he threw\\r\\nhimself down into his chair once more. “That fellow will rise from\\r\\ncrime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.\\r\\nThe case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr. Hosmer\\r\\nAngel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was\\r\\nequally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident,\\r\\nas far as we could see, was the step-father. Then the fact that the\\r\\ntwo men were never together, but that the one always appeared when\\r\\nthe other was away, was suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and\\r\\nthe curious voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy\\r\\nwhiskers. My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action\\r\\nin type-writing his signature, which, of course, inferred that his\\r\\nhandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognize even the\\r\\nsmallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts, together with\\r\\nmany minor ones, all pointed in the same direction.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you verify them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I\\r\\nknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed\\r\\ndescription, I eliminated everything from it which could be the result\\r\\nof a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it\\r\\nto the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it\\r\\nanswered to the description of any of their travellers. I had already\\r\\nnoticed the peculiarities of the type-writer, and I wrote to the man\\r\\nhimself at his business address, asking him if he would come here. As\\r\\nI expected, his reply was type-written, and revealed the same trivial\\r\\nbut characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from\\r\\nWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the description\\r\\ntallied in every respect with that of their employé, James Windibank.\\r\\n_Voila tout!_”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And Miss Sutherland?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old\\r\\nPersian saying, ‘There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and\\r\\ndanger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.’ There is as\\r\\nmuch sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure IV\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the maid\\r\\nbrought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes, and ran in this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\\r\\nthe West of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall\\r\\nbe glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect. Leave\\r\\nPaddington by the 11.15.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you say, dear?” said my wife, looking across at me. “Will you\\r\\ngo?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really don’t know what to say. I have a fairly long list at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking a\\r\\nlittle pale lately. I think that the change would do you good, and you\\r\\nare always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes’s cases.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one\\r\\nof them,” I answered. “But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I\\r\\nhave only half an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect\\r\\nof making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were few and\\r\\nsimple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my\\r\\nvalise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing\\r\\nup and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and\\r\\ntaller by his long gray travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is really very good of you to come, Watson,” said he. “It makes a\\r\\nconsiderable difference to me, having some one with me on whom I can\\r\\nthoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.\\r\\nIf you will keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers\\r\\nwhich Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged and read,\\r\\nwith intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past\\r\\nReading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball, and\\r\\ntossed them up onto the rack.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you heard anything of the case?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\\r\\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\\r\\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those simple\\r\\ncases which are so extremely difficult.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That sounds a little paradoxical.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clew.\\r\\nThe more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult is\\r\\nit to bring it home. In this case, however, they have established a\\r\\nvery serious case against the son of the murdered man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a murder, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted\\r\\nuntil I have the opportunity of looking personally into it. I will\\r\\nexplain the state of things to you, as far as I have been able to\\r\\nunderstand it, in a very few words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\\r\\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John\\r\\nTurner, who made his money in Australia, and returned some years ago to\\r\\nthe old country. One of the farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was\\r\\nlet to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. The men had\\r\\nknown each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that\\r\\nwhen they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as\\r\\npossible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\\r\\ntenant, but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality,\\r\\nas they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of\\r\\neighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither\\r\\nof them had wives living. They appear to have avoided the society of\\r\\nthe neighboring English families, and to have led retired lives, though\\r\\nboth the McCarthys were fond of sport, and were frequently seen at\\r\\nthe race-meetings of the neighborhood. McCarthy kept two servants—a\\r\\nman and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen\\r\\nat the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\\r\\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On June 3, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\\r\\nHatherley about three in the afternoon, and walked down to the Boscombe\\r\\nPool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the\\r\\nstream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been out with his\\r\\nserving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told the man that he\\r\\nmust hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.\\r\\nFrom that appointment he never came back alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile,\\r\\nand two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old\\r\\nwoman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was William Crowder,\\r\\na game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose\\r\\nthat Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The game-keeper adds that within\\r\\na few minutes of his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr.\\r\\nJames McCarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. To the\\r\\nbest of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and\\r\\nthe son was following him. He thought no more of the matter until he\\r\\nheard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder, the\\r\\ngame-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly-wooded\\r\\nround, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. A girl\\r\\nof fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of\\r\\nthe Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.\\r\\nShe states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood\\r\\nand close by the lake, Mr. McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared\\r\\nto be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using\\r\\nvery strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up\\r\\nhis hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\\r\\nviolence that she ran away, and told her mother when she reached home\\r\\nthat she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, and\\r\\nthat she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said\\r\\nthe words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to the lodge to say\\r\\nthat he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help\\r\\nof the lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his\\r\\nhat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with\\r\\nfresh blood. On following him they found the dead body stretched out\\r\\nupon the grass beside the Pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\\r\\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as might\\r\\nvery well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son’s gun, which\\r\\nwas found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. Under\\r\\nthese circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict\\r\\nof ‘Wilful Murder’ having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday,\\r\\nhe was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross, who have\\r\\nreferred the case to the next assizes. Those are the main facts of the\\r\\ncase as they came out before the coroner and at the police-court.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could hardly imagine a more damning case,” I remarked. “If ever\\r\\ncircumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,” answered Holmes,\\r\\nthoughtfully. “It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if\\r\\nyou shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing\\r\\nin an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different.\\r\\nIt must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave\\r\\nagainst the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the\\r\\nculprit. There are several people in the neighborhood, however, and\\r\\namong them Miss Turner, the daughter of the neighboring land-owner,\\r\\nwho believe in his innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you\\r\\nmay recollect in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the\\r\\ncase in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\\r\\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying\\r\\nwestward at fifty miles an hour, instead of quietly digesting their\\r\\nbreakfasts at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that the facts are so obvious that you will\\r\\nfind little credit to be gained out of this case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,” he answered,\\r\\nlaughing. “Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts\\r\\nwhich may have been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You know me\\r\\ntoo well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either\\r\\nconfirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of\\r\\nemploying, or even of understanding. To take the first example to hand,\\r\\nI very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the\\r\\nright-hand side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have\\r\\nnoted even so self-evident a thing as that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How on earth—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness which\\r\\ncharacterizes you. You shave every morning, and in this season you\\r\\nshave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete\\r\\nas we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively\\r\\nslovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear\\r\\nthat that side is less well illuminated than the other. I could not\\r\\nimagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light, and\\r\\nbeing satisfied with such a result. I only quote this as a trivial\\r\\nexample of observation and inference. Therein lies my _métier_, and it\\r\\nis just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation\\r\\nwhich lies before us. There are one or two minor points which were\\r\\nbrought out in the inquest, and which are worth considering.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “THEY FOUND THE BODY”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the\\r\\nreturn to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary informing\\r\\nhim that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to\\r\\nhear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. This observation of\\r\\nhis had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might\\r\\nhave remained in the minds of the coroner’s jury.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a confession,” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least\\r\\na most suspicious remark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary,” said Holmes, “it is the brightest rift which I can\\r\\nat present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be, he could\\r\\nnot be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances\\r\\nwere very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own\\r\\narrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should have looked upon it as\\r\\nhighly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural\\r\\nunder the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy\\r\\nto a scheming man. His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as\\r\\neither an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint\\r\\nand firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\\r\\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his\\r\\nfather, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far\\r\\nforgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,\\r\\naccording to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise\\r\\nhis hand as if to strike him. The self-reproach and contrition which\\r\\nare displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy\\r\\nmind, rather than of a guilty one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI shook my head. “Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,”\\r\\nI remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the young man’s own account of the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though\\r\\nthere are one or two points in it which are suggestive. You will find\\r\\nit here, and may read it for yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper,\\r\\nand having turned down the sheet, he pointed out the paragraph in which\\r\\nthe unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had\\r\\noccurred. I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage, and read\\r\\nit very carefully. It ran in this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called, and\\r\\ngave evidence as follows: ‘I had been away from home for three days at\\r\\nBristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday,\\r\\nthe 3rd. My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and\\r\\nI was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John\\r\\nCobb, the groom. Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap\\r\\nin the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk\\r\\nrapidly out of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he\\r\\nwas going. I then took my gun, and strolled out in the direction of\\r\\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit-warren\\r\\nwhich is upon the other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, the\\r\\ngame-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in\\r\\nthinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in\\r\\nfront of me. When about a hundred yards from the Pool I heard a cry of\\r\\n“Cooee!” which was a usual signal between my father and myself. I then\\r\\nhurried forward, and found him standing by the Pool. He appeared to be\\r\\nmuch surprised at seeing me, and asked me rather roughly what I was\\r\\ndoing there. A conversation ensued which led to high words, and almost\\r\\nto blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing\\r\\nthat his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him, and returned\\r\\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however,\\r\\nwhen I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back\\r\\nagain. I found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head\\r\\nterribly injured. I dropped my gun, and held him in my arms, but he\\r\\nalmost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, and then\\r\\nmade my way to Mr. Turner’s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest,\\r\\nto ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, and\\r\\nI have no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular man,\\r\\nbeing somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners; but he had, as far\\r\\nas I know, no active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion\\r\\nto a rat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father had\\r\\nthis final quarrel?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you\\r\\nthat it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point out to\\r\\nyou that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably\\r\\nin any future proceedings which may arise.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I must still refuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: I understand that the cry of ‘Cooee’ was a common signal\\r\\nbetween you and your father?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: It was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,\\r\\nand before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you\\r\\nreturned on hearing the cry, and found your father fatally injured?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: Nothing definite.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Coroner: What do you mean?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open,\\r\\nthat I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet I have a vague\\r\\nimpression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the\\r\\nleft of me. It seemed to me to be something gray in color, a coat of\\r\\nsome sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked\\r\\nround for it, but it was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, it was gone.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You cannot say what it was?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I had a feeling something was there.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘How far from the body?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘A dozen yards or so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And how far from the edge of the wood?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘About the same.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of\\r\\nit?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, but with my back towards it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“This concluded the examination of the witness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see,” said I, as I glanced down the column, “that the coroner in\\r\\nhis concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls\\r\\nattention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having\\r\\nsignalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details\\r\\nof his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his\\r\\nfather’s dying words. They are all, as he remarks, very much against\\r\\nthe son.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed softly to himself, and stretched himself out upon the\\r\\ncushioned seat. “Both you and the coroner have been at some pains,”\\r\\nsaid he, “to single out the very strongest points in the young man’s\\r\\nfavor. Don’t you see that you alternately give him credit for having\\r\\ntoo much imagination and too little. Too little, if he could not invent\\r\\na cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury;\\r\\ntoo much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything\\r\\nso _outré_ as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the\\r\\nvanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from the point of\\r\\nview that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither\\r\\nthat hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\\r\\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of\\r\\naction. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be there in twenty\\r\\nminutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly four o’clock when we at last, after passing through\\r\\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\\r\\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A lean,\\r\\nferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the\\r\\nplatform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings\\r\\nwhich he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in recognizing Lestrade, of Scotland Yard. With him we drove\\r\\nto the Hereford Arms, where a room had already been engaged for us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have ordered a carriage,” said Lestrade, as we sat over a cup of\\r\\ntea. “I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy\\r\\nuntil you had been on the scene of the crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was very nice and complimentary of you,” Holmes answered. “It is\\r\\nentirely a question of barometric pressure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked startled. “I do not quite follow,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud in the\\r\\nsky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the\\r\\nsofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. I do\\r\\nnot think that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed indulgently. “You have, no doubt, already formed your\\r\\nconclusions from the newspapers,” he said. “The case is as plain as a\\r\\npikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. Still,\\r\\nof course, one can’t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.\\r\\nShe had heard of you, and would have your opinion, though I repeatedly\\r\\ntold her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not\\r\\nalready done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most\\r\\nlovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes\\r\\nshining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of\\r\\nher natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!” she cried, glancing from one to the other\\r\\nof us, and finally, with a woman’s quick intuition, fastening upon my\\r\\ncompanion, “I am so glad that you have come. I have driven down to tell\\r\\nyou so. I know that James didn’t do it. I know it, and I want you to\\r\\nstart upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon\\r\\nthat point. We have known each other since we were little children, and\\r\\nI know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to\\r\\nhurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to any one who really knows him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,” said Sherlock Holmes. “You may\\r\\nrely upon my doing all that I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do\\r\\nyou not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he\\r\\nis innocent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that it is very probable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, now!” she cried, throwing back her head, and looking defiantly\\r\\nat Lestrade. “You hear! He gives me hopes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am afraid that my colleague has\\r\\nbeen a little quick in forming his conclusions,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did it. And\\r\\nabout his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the reason why he\\r\\nwould not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In what way?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had many\\r\\ndisagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should\\r\\nbe a marriage between us. James and I have always loved each other as\\r\\nbrother and sister; but of course he is young, and has seen very little\\r\\nof life yet, and—and—well, he naturally did not wish to do anything\\r\\nlike that yet. So there were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your father?” asked Holmes. “Was he in favor of such a union?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of\\r\\nit.” A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one\\r\\nof his keen, questioning glances at her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you for this information,” said he. “May I see your father if I\\r\\ncall to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid the doctor won’t allow it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The doctor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years\\r\\nback, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed,\\r\\nand Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck, and that his nervous system is\\r\\nshattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the\\r\\nold days in Victoria.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! In Victoria! That is important.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, at the mines.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made\\r\\nhis money.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go\\r\\nto the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that\\r\\nI know him to be innocent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will, Miss Turner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if I\\r\\nleave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.” She hurried\\r\\nfrom the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the\\r\\nwheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am ashamed of you, Holmes,” said Lestrade, with dignity, after a few\\r\\nminutes’ silence. “Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to\\r\\ndisappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I call it cruel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“Have you an order to see him in prison?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but only for you and me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have still\\r\\ntime to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ample.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but\\r\\nI shall only be away a couple of hours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the\\r\\nstreets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where I\\r\\nlay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed\\r\\nnovel. The puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared\\r\\nto the deep mystery through which we were groping, and I found my\\r\\nattention wander so continually from the fiction to the fact, that I\\r\\nat last flung it across the room, and gave myself up entirely to a\\r\\nconsideration of the events of the day. Supposing that this unhappy\\r\\nyoung man’s story was absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what\\r\\nabsolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred\\r\\nbetween the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\\r\\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was something\\r\\nterrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the nature of the\\r\\ninjuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang the bell,\\r\\nand called for the weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim\\r\\naccount of the inquest. In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that\\r\\nthe posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the\\r\\noccipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.\\r\\nI marked the spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been\\r\\nstruck from behind. That was to some extent in favor of the accused,\\r\\nas when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still,\\r\\nit did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\\r\\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\\r\\nHolmes’s attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying reference\\r\\nto a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A man dying\\r\\nfrom a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more\\r\\nlikely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could\\r\\nit indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation.\\r\\nAnd then the incident of the gray cloth, seen by young McCarthy. If\\r\\nthat were true, the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress,\\r\\npresumably his overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood\\r\\nto return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling\\r\\nwith his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue of mysteries\\r\\nand improbabilities the whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade’s\\r\\nopinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’s insight that\\r\\nI could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen\\r\\nhis conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for\\r\\nLestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The glass still keeps very high,” he remarked, as he sat down. “It is\\r\\nof importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the\\r\\nground. On the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest\\r\\nfor such nice work as that, and I did not wish to do it when fagged by\\r\\na long journey. I have seen young McCarthy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what did you learn from him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could he throw no light?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had\\r\\ndone it, and was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he\\r\\nis as puzzled as every one else. He is not a very quick-witted youth,\\r\\nthough comely to look at, and, I should think, sound at heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot admire his taste,” I remarked, “if it is indeed a fact that\\r\\nhe was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this Miss\\r\\nTurner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\\r\\ninsanely in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a\\r\\nlad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at\\r\\na boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of\\r\\na barmaid in Bristol, and marry her at a registry office? No one knows\\r\\na word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to\\r\\nhim to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to\\r\\ndo, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy\\r\\nof this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his\\r\\nfather, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\\r\\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and\\r\\nhis father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown\\r\\nhim over utterly had he known the truth. It was with his barmaid wife\\r\\nthat he had spent the last three days in Bristol, and his father did\\r\\nnot know where he was. Mark that point. It is of importance. Good has\\r\\ncome out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers\\r\\nthat he is in serious trouble, and likely to be hanged, has thrown\\r\\nhim over utterly, and has written to him to say that she has a husband\\r\\nalready in the Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between\\r\\nthem. I think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\\r\\nthat he has suffered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if he is innocent, who has done it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points.\\r\\nOne is that the murdered man had an appointment with some one at the\\r\\nPool, and that the some one could not have been his son, for his son\\r\\nwas away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that\\r\\nthe murdered man was heard to cry ‘Cooee!’ before he knew that his son\\r\\nhad returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends.\\r\\nAnd now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall\\r\\nleave all minor matters until to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\\r\\nbright and cloudless. At nine o’clock Lestrade called for us with the\\r\\ncarriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is serious news this morning,” Lestrade observed. “It is said\\r\\nthat Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“An elderly man, I presume?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\\r\\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business\\r\\nhas had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthy’s,\\r\\nand, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he\\r\\ngave him Hatherley Farm rent free.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! That is interesting,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about\\r\\nhere speaks of his kindness to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\\r\\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been\\r\\nunder such obligations to Turner, should still talk of marrying his\\r\\nson to Turner’s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate,\\r\\nand that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of\\r\\na proposal and all else would follow? It is the more strange, since we\\r\\nknow that Turner himself was averse to the idea. The daughter told us\\r\\nas much. Do you not deduce something from that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have got to the deductions and the inferences,” said Lestrade,\\r\\nwinking at me. “I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without\\r\\nflying away after theories and fancies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are right,” said Holmes, demurely; “you do find it very hard to\\r\\ntackle the facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to\\r\\nget hold of,” replied Lestrade, with some warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that is—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That McCarthy, senior, met his death from McCarthy, junior, and that\\r\\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,” said Holmes, laughing.\\r\\n“But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon the\\r\\nleft.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is it.” It was a wide-spread, comfortable-looking building,\\r\\ntwo-storied, slate roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon\\r\\nthe gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,\\r\\ngave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still\\r\\nlay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes’s\\r\\nrequest, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his\\r\\ndeath, and also a pair of the son’s, though not the pair which he had\\r\\nthen had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight\\r\\ndifferent points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from\\r\\nwhich we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “THE MAID SHOWED US THE BOOTS.”]\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\\r\\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\\r\\nBaker Street would have failed to recognize him. His face flushed and\\r\\ndarkened. His brows were drawn into two hard, black lines, while his\\r\\neyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. His face was\\r\\nbent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins\\r\\nstood out like whip-cord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed\\r\\nto dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so\\r\\nabsolutely concentrated upon the matter before him, that a question\\r\\nor remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked\\r\\na quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his\\r\\nway along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\\r\\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is all\\r\\nthat district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path\\r\\nand amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. Sometimes\\r\\nHolmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a\\r\\nlittle _détour_ into the meadow. Lestrade and I walked behind him, the\\r\\ndetective indifferent and contemptuous, while I watched my friend with\\r\\nthe interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his\\r\\nactions was directed towards a definite end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some\\r\\nfifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley\\r\\nFarm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner. Above the woods\\r\\nwhich lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting\\r\\npinnacles which marked the site of the rich land-owner’s dwelling. On\\r\\nthe Hatherley side of the Pool the woods grew very thick, and there was\\r\\na narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of\\r\\nthe trees and the reeds which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the\\r\\nexact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was\\r\\nthe ground, that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by\\r\\nthe fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\\r\\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the\\r\\ntrampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and\\r\\nthen turned upon my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you go into the Pool for?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or\\r\\nother trace. But how on earth—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its inward\\r\\ntwist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and there it\\r\\nvanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all have been had I\\r\\nbeen here before they came like a herd of buffalo, and wallowed all\\r\\nover it. Here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they\\r\\nhave covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. But\\r\\nhere are three separate tracks of the same feet.” He drew out a lens,\\r\\nand lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all\\r\\nthe time rather to himself than to us. “These are young McCarthy’s\\r\\nfeet. Twice he was walking, and once he ran swiftly so that the soles\\r\\nare deeply marked, and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\\r\\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are the\\r\\nfather’s feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It is the\\r\\nbutt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this? Ha, ha! What\\r\\nhave we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They\\r\\ncome, they go, they come again—of course that was for the cloak.\\r\\nNow where did they come from?” He ran up and down, sometimes losing,\\r\\nsometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the\\r\\nwood, and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the\\r\\nneighborhood. Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this, and\\r\\nlay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.\\r\\nFor a long time he remained there, turning over the leaves and dried\\r\\nsticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope, and\\r\\nexamining with his lens not only the ground, but even the bark of the\\r\\ntree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among the moss,\\r\\nand this also he carefully examined and retained. Then he followed a\\r\\npathway through the wood until he came to the high-road, where all\\r\\ntraces were lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has been a case of considerable interest,” he remarked, returning\\r\\nto his natural manner. “I fancy that this gray house on the right must\\r\\nbe the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran, and\\r\\nperhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our\\r\\nluncheon. You may walk to the cab, and I shall be with you presently.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab, and drove back\\r\\ninto Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked\\r\\nup in the wood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This may interest you, Lestrade,” he remarked, holding it out. “The\\r\\nmurder was done with it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see no marks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are none.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days.\\r\\nThere was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds\\r\\nwith the injuries. There is no sign of any other weapon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the murderer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\\r\\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a gray cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses\\r\\na cigar-holder, and carries a blunt penknife in his pocket. There are\\r\\nseveral other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our\\r\\nsearch.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed. “I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,” he said.\\r\\n“Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed\\r\\nBritish jury.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_Nous verrons_,” answered Holmes, calmly. “You work your own method,\\r\\nand I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, and shall\\r\\nprobably return to London by the evening train.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And leave your case unfinished?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, finished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the mystery?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is solved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who was the criminal, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The gentleman I describe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who is he?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\\r\\npopulous neighborhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. “I am a practical man,” he said,\\r\\n“and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\\r\\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game-leg. I should become the\\r\\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right,” said Holmes, quietly. “I have given you the chance. Here\\r\\nare your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we\\r\\nfound lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought\\r\\nwith a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a\\r\\nperplexing position.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Watson,” he said, when the cloth was cleared; “just sit\\r\\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don’t quite\\r\\nknow what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a cigar, and let\\r\\nme expound.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young\\r\\nMcCarthy’s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they\\r\\nimpressed me in his favor and you against him. One was the fact that\\r\\nhis father should, according to his account, cry ‘Cooee!’ before seeing\\r\\nhim. The other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled\\r\\nseveral words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son’s\\r\\near. Now from this double point our research must commence, and we will\\r\\nbegin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of this ‘Cooee!’ then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The son, as\\r\\nfar as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within\\r\\near-shot. The ‘Cooee!’ was meant to attract the attention of whoever\\r\\nit was that he had the appointment with. But ‘Cooee’ is a distinctly\\r\\nAustralian cry, and one which is used between Australians. There is a\\r\\nstrong presumption that the person whom McCarthy expected to meet him\\r\\nat Boscombe Pool was some one who had been in Australia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What of the rat, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it\\r\\nout on the table. “This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,” he said.\\r\\n“I wired to Bristol for it last night.” He put his hand over part of\\r\\nthe map. “What do you read?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“ARAT,” I read.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now?” He raised his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“BALLARAT.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only\\r\\ncaught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter the name of his\\r\\nmurderer. So-and-so, of Ballarat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is wonderful!” I exclaimed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\\r\\nconsiderably. The possession of a gray garment was a third point\\r\\nwhich, granting the son’s statement to be correct, was a certainty. We\\r\\nhave come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an\\r\\nAustralian from Ballarat with a gray cloak.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And one who was at home in the district, for the Pool can only be\\r\\napproached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly\\r\\nwander.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the ground I\\r\\ngained the trifling details which I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as\\r\\nto the personality of the criminal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how did you gain them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know my method. It is founded upon the observance of trifles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his\\r\\nstride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they were peculiar boots.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But his lameness?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his\\r\\nleft. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped—he was lame.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But his left-handedness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\\r\\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from immediately\\r\\nbehind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can that be unless it\\r\\nwere by a left-handed man? He had stood behind that tree during the\\r\\ninterview between the father and son. He had even smoked there. I found\\r\\nthe ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enabled\\r\\nme to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some\\r\\nattention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140\\r\\ndifferent varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found\\r\\nthe ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\\r\\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety which\\r\\nare rolled in Rotterdam.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the cigar-holder?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used\\r\\na holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not\\r\\na clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I said, “you have drawn a net round this man from which he\\r\\ncannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as\\r\\nif you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the direction in\\r\\nwhich all this points. The culprit is—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. John Turner,” cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our\\r\\nsitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His slow,\\r\\nlimping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,\\r\\nand yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous\\r\\nlimbs showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and\\r\\nof character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding,\\r\\ndrooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his\\r\\nappearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the\\r\\ncorners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear\\r\\nto me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic\\r\\ndisease.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray sit down on the sofa,” said Holmes, gently. “You had my note?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see\\r\\nme here to avoid scandal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why did you wish to see me?” He looked across at my companion with\\r\\ndespair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. “It is\\r\\nso. I know all about McCarthy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. “God help me!” he cried. “But I\\r\\nwould not have let the young man come to harm. I give you my word that\\r\\nI would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad to hear you say so,” said Holmes, gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would\\r\\nbreak her heart—it will break her heart when she hears that I am\\r\\narrested.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may not come to that,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who\\r\\nrequired my presence here, and I am acting in her interests. Young\\r\\nMcCarthy must be got off, however.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a dying man,” said old Turner. “I have had diabetes for years. My\\r\\ndoctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would\\r\\nrather die under my own roof than in a jail.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a\\r\\nbundle of paper before him. “Just tell us the truth,” he said. “I\\r\\nshall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson here can witness\\r\\nit. Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save\\r\\nyoung McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is\\r\\nabsolutely needed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s as well,” said the old man; “it’s a question whether I shall live\\r\\nto the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare\\r\\nAlice the shock. And now I will make the thing clear to you; it has\\r\\nbeen a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You didn’t know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I\\r\\ntell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.\\r\\nHis grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my\\r\\nlife. I’ll tell you first how I came to be in his power.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was in the early sixties at the diggings. I was a young chap then,\\r\\nhot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got\\r\\namong bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to\\r\\nthe bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway\\r\\nrobber. There were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,\\r\\nsticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the\\r\\nroad to the diggings. Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under,\\r\\nand our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and we\\r\\nlay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers and six of\\r\\nus, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at\\r\\nthe first volley. Three of our boys were killed, however, before we\\r\\ngot the swag. I put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was\\r\\nthis very man McCarthy. I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then,\\r\\nbut I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face,\\r\\nas though to remember every feature. We got away with the gold, became\\r\\nwealthy men, and made our way over to England without being suspected.\\r\\nThere I parted from my old pals, and determined to settle down to a\\r\\nquiet and respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be\\r\\nin the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\\r\\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too, and\\r\\nthough my wife died young, she left me my dear little Alice. Even when\\r\\nshe was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path\\r\\nas nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf, and\\r\\ndid my best to make up for the past. All was going well when McCarthy\\r\\nlaid his grip upon me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in Regent\\r\\nStreet with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Here we are, Jack,’ says he, touching me on the arm; ‘we’ll be as\\r\\ngood as a family to you. There’s two of us, me and my son, and you can\\r\\nhave the keeping of us. If you don’t—it’s a fine, law-abiding country\\r\\nis England, and there’s always a policeman within hail.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, down they came to the West country, there was no shaking them\\r\\noff, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.\\r\\nThere was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I\\r\\nwould, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse\\r\\nas Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid of her knowing my\\r\\npast than of the police. Whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever\\r\\nit was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last\\r\\nhe asked a thing which I could not give. He asked for Alice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was known\\r\\nto be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad\\r\\nshould step into the whole property. But there I was firm. I would not\\r\\nhave his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that I had any dislike to\\r\\nthe lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. I stood firm.\\r\\nMcCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at\\r\\nthe Pool midway between our houses to talk it over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I smoked\\r\\na cigar, and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I\\r\\nlistened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to\\r\\ncome uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter with as\\r\\nlittle regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off\\r\\nthe streets. It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most\\r\\ndear should be in the power of such a man as this. Could I not snap the\\r\\nbond? I was already a dying and a desperate man. Though clear of mind\\r\\nand fairly strong of limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my\\r\\nmemory and my girl! Both could be saved, if I could but silence that\\r\\nfoul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I\\r\\nhave sinned, I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that\\r\\nmy girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\\r\\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction than if\\r\\nhe had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought back his son;\\r\\nbut I had gained the cover of the wood, though I was forced to go back\\r\\nto fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight. That is the true\\r\\nstory, gentlemen, of all that occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is not for me to judge you,” said Holmes, as the old man\\r\\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. “I pray that we may\\r\\nnever be exposed to such a temptation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will\\r\\nsoon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes.\\r\\nI will keep your confession, and, if McCarthy is condemned, I shall be\\r\\nforced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and\\r\\nyour secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Farewell, then,” said the old man, solemnly. “Your own death-beds,\\r\\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which\\r\\nyou have given to mine.” Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame,\\r\\nhe stumbled slowly from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God help us!” said Holmes, after a long silence. “Why does fate play\\r\\nsuch tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such a case as\\r\\nthis that I do not think of Baxter’s words, and say, ‘There, but for\\r\\nthe grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes, on the strength of a\\r\\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes, and submitted\\r\\nto the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our\\r\\ninterview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son\\r\\nand daughter may come to live happily together, in ignorance of the\\r\\nblack cloud which rests upon their past.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure V\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE FIVE ORANGE PIPS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases\\r\\nbetween the years ’82 and ’90, I am faced by so many which present\\r\\nstrange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know\\r\\nwhich to choose and which to leave. Some, however, have already gained\\r\\npublicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field\\r\\nfor those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a\\r\\ndegree, and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. Some,\\r\\ntoo, have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,\\r\\nbeginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially\\r\\ncleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture\\r\\nand surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\\r\\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in\\r\\nits details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give\\r\\nsome account of it, in spite of the fact that there are points in\\r\\nconnection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,\\r\\nentirely cleared up.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\\r\\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings\\r\\nunder this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of\\r\\nthe Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a\\r\\nluxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the\\r\\nfacts connected with the loss of the British bark _Sophy Anderson_, of\\r\\nthe singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa,\\r\\nand finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may\\r\\nbe remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man’s\\r\\nwatch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\\r\\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time—a deduction\\r\\nwhich was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these\\r\\nI may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such\\r\\nsingular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have\\r\\nnow taken up my pen to describe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had\\r\\nset in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had screamed and the\\r\\nrain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart\\r\\nof great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for the\\r\\ninstant from the routine of life, and to recognize the presence of\\r\\nthose great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars\\r\\nof his civilization, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in,\\r\\nthe storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a\\r\\nchild in the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\\r\\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the other was\\r\\ndeep in one of Clark Russell’s fine sea-stories, until the howl of the\\r\\ngale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the\\r\\nrain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. My wife was\\r\\non a visit to her mother’s, and for a few days I was a dweller once\\r\\nmore in my old quarters at Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said I, glancing up at my companion, “that was surely the bell.\\r\\nWho could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except yourself I have none,” he answered. “I do not encourage\\r\\nvisitors.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A client, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out on\\r\\nsuch a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to\\r\\nbe some crony of the landlady’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came\\r\\na step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He stretched out his\\r\\nlong arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant\\r\\nchair upon which a new-comer must sit. “Come in!” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,\\r\\nwell-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy\\r\\nin his bearing. The steaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and\\r\\nhis long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he\\r\\nhad come. He looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and\\r\\nI could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a\\r\\nman who is weighed down with some great anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I owe you an apology,” he said, raising his golden _pince-nez_ to his\\r\\neyes. “I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have brought some\\r\\ntraces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me your coat and umbrella,” said Holmes. “They may rest here\\r\\non the hook, and will be dry presently. You have come up from the\\r\\nsouth-west, I see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, from Horsham.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe-caps is quite\\r\\ndistinctive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have come for advice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is easily got.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And help.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is not always so easy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how\\r\\nyou saved him in the Tankerville Club Scandal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He said that you could solve anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He said too much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That you are never beaten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been beaten four times—three times by men, and once by a\\r\\nwoman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what is that compared with the number of your successes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true that I have been generally successful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you may be so with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire, and favor me with\\r\\nsome details as to your case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is no ordinary one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of appeal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have\\r\\never listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events\\r\\nthan those which have happened in my own family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You fill me with interest,” said Holmes. “Pray give us the essential\\r\\nfacts from the commencement, and I can afterwards question you as to\\r\\nthose details which seem to me to be most important.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man pulled his chair up, and pushed his wet feet out towards\\r\\nthe blaze.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name,” said he, “is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far\\r\\nas I can understand it, little to do with this awful business. It is an\\r\\nhereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, I must\\r\\ngo back to the commencement of the affair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must know that my grandfather had two sons—my uncle Elias and\\r\\nmy father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, which\\r\\nhe enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He was the\\r\\npatentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with\\r\\nsuch success that he was able to sell it, and to retire upon a handsome\\r\\ncompetence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man, and\\r\\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\\r\\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson’s army, and\\r\\nafterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid\\r\\ndown his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained\\r\\nfor three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe,\\r\\nand took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very\\r\\nconsiderable fortune in the States, and his reason for leaving them was\\r\\nhis aversion to the negroes, and his dislike of the Republican policy\\r\\nin extending the franchise to them. He was a singular man, fierce and\\r\\nquick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most\\r\\nretiring disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham I\\r\\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or three\\r\\nfields round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though\\r\\nvery often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank\\r\\na great deal of brandy, and smoked very heavily, but he would see no\\r\\nsociety, and did not want any friends, not even his own brother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He didn’t mind me, in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time\\r\\nwhen he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This would be\\r\\nin the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He\\r\\nbegged my father to let me live with him, and he was very kind to me\\r\\nin his way. When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon\\r\\nand draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with\\r\\nthe servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that I was\\r\\nsixteen I was quite master of the house. I kept all the keys, and could\\r\\ngo where I liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him\\r\\nin his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had\\r\\na single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably\\r\\nlocked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to\\r\\nenter. With a boy’s curiosity I have peeped through the key-hole, but\\r\\nI was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and\\r\\nbundles as would be expected in such a room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One day—it was in March, 1883—a letter with a foreign stamp lay\\r\\nupon the table in front of the Colonel’s plate. It was not a common\\r\\nthing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in\\r\\nready money, and he had no friends of any sort. ‘From India!’ said he,\\r\\nas he took it up, ‘Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?’ Opening\\r\\nit hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, which\\r\\npattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but the laugh\\r\\nwas struck from my lips at the sight of his face. His lip had fallen,\\r\\nhis eyes were protruding, his skin the color of putty, and he glared at\\r\\nthe envelope which he still held in his trembling hand. ‘K. K. K.!’ he\\r\\nshrieked, and then, ‘My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What is it, uncle?’ I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Death,’ said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,\\r\\nleaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope, and saw\\r\\nscrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter\\r\\nK three times repeated. There was nothing else save the five dried\\r\\npips. What could be the reason of his overpowering terror? I left the\\r\\nbreakfast-table, and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with\\r\\nan old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,\\r\\nand a small brass box, like a cash-box, in the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘They may do what they like, but I’ll checkmate them still,’ said he,\\r\\nwith an oath. ‘Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day,\\r\\nand send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step\\r\\nup to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there\\r\\nwas a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass\\r\\nbox stood open and empty beside it. As I glanced at the box I noticed,\\r\\nwith a start, that upon the lid were printed the treble K which I had\\r\\nread in the morning upon the envelope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I wish you, John,’ said my uncle, ‘to witness my will. I leave\\r\\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my\\r\\nbrother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you\\r\\ncan enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you cannot, take my\\r\\nadvice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to\\r\\ngive you such a two-edged thing, but I can’t say what turn things are\\r\\ngoing to take. Kindly sign the paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.\\r\\nThe singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression\\r\\nupon me, and I pondered over it, and turned it every way in my mind\\r\\nwithout being able to make anything of it. Yet I could not shake off\\r\\nthe vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the sensation\\r\\ngrew less keen as the weeks passed, and nothing happened to disturb\\r\\nthe usual routine of our lives. I could see a change in my uncle,\\r\\nhowever. He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any\\r\\nsort of society. Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the\\r\\ndoor locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort\\r\\nof drunken frenzy, and would burst out of the house and tear about the\\r\\ngarden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid\\r\\nof no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen,\\r\\nby man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush\\r\\ntumultuously in at the door, and lock and bar it behind him, like a man\\r\\nwho can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the\\r\\nroots of his soul. At such times I have seen his face, even on a cold\\r\\nday, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to abuse\\r\\nyour patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken\\r\\nsallies from which he never came back. We found him, when we went to\\r\\nsearch for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay\\r\\nat the foot of the garden. There was no sign of any violence, and the\\r\\nwater was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his\\r\\nknown eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. But I, who knew\\r\\nhow he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade\\r\\nmyself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\\r\\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of\\r\\nsome £14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment,” Holmes interposed. “Your statement is, I foresee, one\\r\\nof the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me have the\\r\\ndate of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his\\r\\nsupposed suicide.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The latter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later,\\r\\nupon the night of May 2d.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. Pray proceed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my request, made\\r\\na careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. We\\r\\nfound the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On\\r\\nthe inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of K. K.\\r\\nK. repeated upon it, and ‘Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register’\\r\\nwritten beneath. These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers\\r\\nwhich had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\\r\\nnothing of much importance in the attic, save a great many scattered\\r\\npapers and note-books bearing upon my uncle’s life in America. Some\\r\\nof them were of the war time, and showed that he had done his duty\\r\\nwell, and had borne the repute of a brave soldier. Others were of a\\r\\ndate during the reconstruction of the Southern States, and were mostly\\r\\nconcerned with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in\\r\\nopposing the carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the\\r\\nNorth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it was the beginning of ’84 when my father came to live at\\r\\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the January\\r\\nof ’85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a\\r\\nsharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. There\\r\\nhe was, sitting with a newly-opened envelope in one hand and five dried\\r\\norange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. He had always\\r\\nlaughed at what he called my cock-and-a-bull story about the Colonel,\\r\\nbut he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come\\r\\nupon himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what on earth does this mean, John?’ he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My heart had turned to lead. ‘It is K. K. K.,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He looked inside the envelope. ‘So it is,’ he cried. ‘Here are the\\r\\nvery letters. But what is this written above them?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Put the papers on the sundial,’ I read, peeping over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What papers? What sundial?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The sundial in the garden. There is no other,’ said I; ‘but the\\r\\npapers must be those that are destroyed.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Pooh!’ said he, gripping hard at his courage. ‘We are in a civilized\\r\\nland here, and we can’t have tomfoolery of this kind. Where does the\\r\\nthing come from?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘From Dundee,’ I answered, glancing at the post-mark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Some preposterous practical joke,’ said he. ‘What have I to do with\\r\\nsundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such nonsense.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I should certainly speak to the police,’ I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then let me do so?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I forbid you. I won’t have a fuss made about such nonsense.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. I\\r\\nwent about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from\\r\\nhome to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is in command\\r\\nof one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go,\\r\\nfor it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away\\r\\nfrom home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon the second day of his\\r\\nabsence I received a telegram from the Major, imploring me to come at\\r\\nonce. My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound\\r\\nin the neighborhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\\r\\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his\\r\\nconsciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in\\r\\nthe twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit\\r\\nunfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of ‘Death\\r\\nfrom accidental causes.’ Carefully as I examined every fact connected\\r\\nwith his death, I was unable to find anything which could suggest the\\r\\nidea of murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\\r\\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. And\\r\\nyet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that I\\r\\nwas wellnigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why\\r\\nI did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well convinced that\\r\\nour troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle’s\\r\\nlife, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was in January, ’85, that my poor father met his end, and two years\\r\\nand eight months have elapsed since then. During that time I have lived\\r\\nhappily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed\\r\\naway from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. I\\r\\nhad begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow\\r\\nfell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and, turning\\r\\nto the table, he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is the envelope,” he continued. “The post-mark is London—eastern\\r\\ndivision. Within are the very words which were upon my father’s last\\r\\nmessage: ‘K. K. K.’; and then ‘Put the papers on the sundial.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have you done?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To tell the truth”—he sank his face into his thin, white hands—“I\\r\\nhave felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when\\r\\nthe snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in the grasp of some\\r\\nresistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can\\r\\nguard against.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut! tut!” cried Sherlock Holmes. “You must act, man, or you are lost.\\r\\nNothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have seen the police.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that the\\r\\ninspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical\\r\\njokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as\\r\\nthe jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. “Incredible imbecility!” he\\r\\ncried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the\\r\\nhouse with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Has he come with you to-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. His orders were to stay in the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did you come to me?” he said; “and, above all, why did you not\\r\\ncome at once?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast\\r\\nabout my troubles, and was advised by him to come to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have acted\\r\\nbefore this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than that which\\r\\nyou have placed before us—no suggestive detail which might help us?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is one thing,” said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\\r\\npocket, and drawing out a piece of discolored, blue-tinted paper, he\\r\\nlaid it out upon the table. “I have some remembrance,” said he, “that\\r\\non the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small,\\r\\nunburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular\\r\\ncolor. I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and I am\\r\\ninclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,\\r\\nfluttered out from among the others, and in that way have escaped\\r\\ndestruction. Beyond the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us\\r\\nmuch. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. The\\r\\nwriting is undoubtedly my uncle’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which\\r\\nshowed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It\\r\\nwas headed, “March, 1869,” and beneath were the following enigmatical\\r\\nnotices:\\r\\n\\r\\n“4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n“7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and John Swain, of St.\\r\\nAugustine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“9th. McCauley cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“10th. John Swain cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“12th. Visited Paramore. All well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes, folding up the paper, and returning it to\\r\\nour visitor. “And now you must on no account lose another instant. We\\r\\ncannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. You must get\\r\\nhome instantly and act.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What shall I do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put\\r\\nthis piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which\\r\\nyou have described. You must also put in a note to say that all the\\r\\nother papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only\\r\\none which remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry\\r\\nconviction with them. Having done this, you must at once put the box\\r\\nout upon the sundial, as directed. Do you understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Entirely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I think\\r\\nthat we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to\\r\\nweave, while theirs is already woven. The first consideration is to\\r\\nremove the pressing danger which threatens you. The second is to clear\\r\\nup the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank you,” said the young man, rising, and pulling on his overcoat.\\r\\n“You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall certainly do as you\\r\\nadvise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in the\\r\\nmeanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are\\r\\nthreatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you go back?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By train from Waterloo.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that you\\r\\nmay be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am armed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall see you at Horsham, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to\\r\\nthe box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every particular.”\\r\\nHe shook hands with us, and took his leave. Outside the wind still\\r\\nscreamed, and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows.\\r\\nThis strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad\\r\\nelements—blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale—and now\\r\\nto have been reabsorbed by them once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\\r\\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he lit\\r\\nhis pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings\\r\\nas they chased each other up to the ceiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, Watson,” he remarked at last, “that of all our cases we have\\r\\nhad none more fantastic than this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems to\\r\\nme to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But have you,” I asked, “formed any definite conception as to what\\r\\nthese perils are?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There can be no question as to their nature,” he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue this\\r\\nunhappy family?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms\\r\\nof his chair, with his finger-tips together. “The ideal reasoner,” he\\r\\nremarked, “would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all\\r\\nits bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which\\r\\nled up to it, but also all the results which would follow from it. As\\r\\nCuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of\\r\\na single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link\\r\\nin a series of incidents, should be able to accurately state all the\\r\\nother ones, both before and after. We have not yet grasped the results\\r\\nwhich the reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the\\r\\nstudy which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\\r\\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest pitch,\\r\\nit is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilize all the\\r\\nfacts which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies,\\r\\nas you will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even\\r\\nin these days of free education and encyclopædias, is a somewhat rare\\r\\naccomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a man should\\r\\npossess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,\\r\\nand this I have endeavored in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you\\r\\non one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\\r\\nin a very precise fashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I answered, laughing. “It was a singular document. Philosophy,\\r\\nastronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany\\r\\nvariable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region\\r\\nwithin fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,\\r\\nsensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,\\r\\nswordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I\\r\\nthink, were the main points of my analysis.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes grinned at the last item. “Well,” he said, “I say now, as I said\\r\\nthen, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all\\r\\nthe furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away\\r\\nin the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants\\r\\nit. Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us\\r\\nto-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. Kindly hand\\r\\nme down the letter K of the American Encyclopædia which stands upon\\r\\nthe shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider the situation,\\r\\nand see what may be deduced from it. In the first place, we may start\\r\\nwith a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong\\r\\nreason for leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all\\r\\ntheir habits, and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida\\r\\nfor the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love of\\r\\nsolitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of some one\\r\\nor something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear\\r\\nof some one or something which drove him from America. As to what it\\r\\nwas he feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable\\r\\nletters which were received by himself and his successors. Did you\\r\\nremark the post-marks of those letters?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the third\\r\\nfrom London.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From East London. What do you deduce from that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent. We have already a clew. There can be no doubt that the\\r\\nprobability—the strong probability—is that the writer was on board\\r\\nof a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the case of\\r\\nPondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,\\r\\nin Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest\\r\\nanything?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A greater distance to travel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the letter had also a greater distance to come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I do not see the point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\\r\\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always sent their\\r\\nsingular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.\\r\\nYou see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from\\r\\nDundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would\\r\\nhave arrived almost as soon as their letter. But as a matter of fact\\r\\nseven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented the\\r\\ndifference between the mail-boat which brought the letter, and the\\r\\nsailing-vessel which brought the writer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly urgency of\\r\\nthis new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to caution. The blow has\\r\\nalways fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to\\r\\ntravel the distance. But this one comes from London, and therefore we\\r\\ncannot count upon delay.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” I cried; “what can it mean, this relentless persecution?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance\\r\\nto the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think that it is quite\\r\\nclear that there must be more than one of them. A single man could not\\r\\nhave carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner’s\\r\\njury. There must have been several in it, and they must have been men\\r\\nof resource and determination. Their papers they mean to have, be the\\r\\nholder of them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be\\r\\nthe initials of an individual, and becomes the badge of a society.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But of what society?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you never—” said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and sinking\\r\\nhis voice—“have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never have.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. “Here it\\r\\nis,” said he, presently, “‘Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the\\r\\nfanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This\\r\\nterrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in\\r\\nthe Southern States after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\\r\\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\\r\\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was used\\r\\nfor political purposes, principally for the terrorizing of the negro\\r\\nvoters, and the murdering and driving from the country of those who\\r\\nwere opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by\\r\\na warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally\\r\\nrecognized shape—a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or\\r\\norange pips in others. On receiving this the victim might either openly\\r\\nabjure his former ways, or might fly from the country. If he braved the\\r\\nmatter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some\\r\\nstrange and unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organization of the\\r\\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case\\r\\nupon record where any man succeeded in braving it with impunity, or in\\r\\nwhich any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators. For\\r\\nsome years the organization flourished, in spite of the efforts of the\\r\\nUnited States Government and of the better classes of the community in\\r\\nthe South. Eventually, in the year 1869, the movement rather suddenly\\r\\ncollapsed, although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort\\r\\nsince that date.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will observe,” said Holmes, laying down the volume, “that the\\r\\nsudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance\\r\\nof Openshaw from America with their papers. It may well have been cause\\r\\nand effect. It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the\\r\\nmore implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this\\r\\nregister and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South,\\r\\nand that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is\\r\\nrecovered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then the page we have seen—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, ‘sent the\\r\\npips to A, B, and C,’—that is, sent the society’s warning to them.\\r\\nThen there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or left the\\r\\ncountry, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a sinister\\r\\nresult for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into\\r\\nthis dark place, and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has\\r\\nin the mean time is to do what I have told him. There is nothing more\\r\\nto be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin, and let\\r\\nus try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still\\r\\nmore miserable ways of our fellow-men.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued\\r\\nbrightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse me for not waiting for you,” said he; “I have, I\\r\\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young\\r\\nOpenshaw’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What steps will you take?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. I may\\r\\nhave to go down to Horsham, after all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will not go there first?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I shall commence with the city. Just ring the bell, and the maid\\r\\nwill bring up your coffee.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced\\r\\nmy eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “you are too late.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!” said he, laying down his cup, “I feared as much. How was it\\r\\ndone?” He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading, ‘Tragedy near\\r\\nWaterloo Bridge.’ Here is the account: ‘Between nine and ten last\\r\\nnight Police-constable Cook, of the H Division, on duty near Waterloo\\r\\nBridge, heard a cry for help and a splash in the water. The night,\\r\\nhowever, was extremely dark and stormy, so that, in spite of the help\\r\\nof several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue.\\r\\nThe alarm, however, was given, and, by the aid of the water-police,\\r\\nthe body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young\\r\\ngentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in\\r\\nhis pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham. It\\r\\nis conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last\\r\\ntrain from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and the extreme\\r\\ndarkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the\\r\\nsmall landing-places for river steamboats. The body exhibited no traces\\r\\nof violence, and there can be no doubt that the deceased had been\\r\\nthe victim of an unfortunate accident, which should have the effect\\r\\nof calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the\\r\\nriver-side landing-stages.’”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and shaken\\r\\nthan I had ever seen him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That hurts my pride, Watson,” he said, at last. “It is a petty\\r\\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter\\r\\nwith me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this\\r\\ngang. That he should come to me for help, and that I should send him\\r\\naway to his death—!” He sprang from his chair and paced about the room\\r\\nin uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks, and a\\r\\nnervous clasping and unclasping of his long, thin hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They must be cunning devils,” he exclaimed, at last. “How could they\\r\\nhave decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the direct line\\r\\nto the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a\\r\\nnight, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in\\r\\nthe long run. I am going out now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘HOLMES,’ I CRIED, ‘YOU ARE TOO LATE’”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the police?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may take\\r\\nthe flies, but not before.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the\\r\\nevening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come\\r\\nback yet. It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale\\r\\nand worn. He walked up to the sideboard, and, tearing a piece from the\\r\\nloaf, he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught\\r\\nof water.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are hungry,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\\r\\nbreakfast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how have you succeeded?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have a clew?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long\\r\\nremain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark\\r\\nupon them. It is well thought of!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and, tearing it to pieces, he\\r\\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five, and thrust\\r\\nthem into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote “S. H. for J.\\r\\nO.” Then he sealed it and addressed it to “Captain James Calhoun, Bark\\r\\n_Lone Star_, Savannah, Georgia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will await him when he enters port,” said he, chuckling. “It may\\r\\ngive him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor of his\\r\\nfate as Openshaw did before him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who is this Captain Calhoun?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you trace it, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates\\r\\nand names.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have spent the whole day,” said he, “over Lloyd’s registers and the\\r\\nfiles of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel\\r\\nwhich touched at Pondicherry in January and February in ’83. There\\r\\nwere thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during\\r\\nthose months. Of these, one, the _Lone Star_, instantly attracted my\\r\\nattention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from\\r\\nLondon, the name is that which is given to one of the States of the\\r\\nUnion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Texas, I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must have an\\r\\nAmerican origin.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the bark _Lone\\r\\nStar_ was there in January, ’85, my suspicion became a certainty. I\\r\\nthen inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of\\r\\nLondon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The _Lone Star_ had arrived here last week. I went down to the Albert\\r\\nDock, and found that she had been taken down the river by the early\\r\\ntide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend,\\r\\nand learned that she had passed some time ago; and as the wind is\\r\\neasterly, I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins, and not\\r\\nvery far from the Isle of Wight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will you do, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are, as I learn,\\r\\nthe only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are Finns and\\r\\nGermans. I know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last\\r\\nnight. I had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By\\r\\nthe time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah the mail-boat will\\r\\nhave carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police\\r\\nof Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a\\r\\ncharge of murder.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and\\r\\nthe murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the orange pips\\r\\nwhich would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as\\r\\nthemselves, was upon their track. Very long and very severe were the\\r\\nequinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news of the _Lone\\r\\nStar_ of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that\\r\\nsomewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was\\r\\nseen swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters “L. S.” carved\\r\\nupon it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the\\r\\n_Lone Star_.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure VI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal of the\\r\\nTheological College of St. George’s, was much addicted to opium. The\\r\\nhabit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he\\r\\nwas at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams\\r\\nand sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt\\r\\nto produce the same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that\\r\\nthe practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years\\r\\nhe continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror\\r\\nand pity to his friends and relatives. I can see him now, with yellow,\\r\\npasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a\\r\\nchair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne night—it was in June, ’89—there came a ring to my bell, about the\\r\\nhour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. I sat up\\r\\nin my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made\\r\\na little face of disappointment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A patient!” said she. “You’ll have to go out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps\\r\\nupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some\\r\\ndark-colored stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my calling so late,” she began, and then, suddenly\\r\\nlosing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my\\r\\nwife’s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. “Oh, I’m in such trouble!”\\r\\nshe cried; “I do so want a little help.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” said my wife, pulling up her veil, “it is Kate Whitney. How you\\r\\nstartled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I came straight to you.” That was always\\r\\nthe way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a\\r\\nlight-house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine and\\r\\nwater, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or should you\\r\\nrather that I sent James off to bed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, no! I want the Doctor’s advice and help, too. It’s about Isa.\\r\\nHe has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband’s\\r\\ntrouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school\\r\\ncompanion. We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.\\r\\nDid she know where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring\\r\\nhim back to her?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that it was. She had the surest information that of late he\\r\\nhad, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest\\r\\neast of the city. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one\\r\\nday, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening.\\r\\nBut now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay\\r\\nthere, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison\\r\\nor sleeping off the effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of\\r\\nit, at the “Bar of Gold,” in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to\\r\\ndo? How could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a\\r\\nplace, and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded\\r\\nhim?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.\\r\\nMight I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second thought,\\r\\nwhy should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney’s medical adviser, and\\r\\nas such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were\\r\\nalone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a\\r\\ncab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had\\r\\ngiven me. And so in ten minutes I had left my arm-chair and cheery\\r\\nsitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a\\r\\nstrange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only\\r\\ncould show how strange it was to be.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.\\r\\nUpper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves\\r\\nwhich line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge.\\r\\nBetween a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of\\r\\nsteps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, I found the\\r\\nden of which I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down\\r\\nthe steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken\\r\\nfeet, and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found\\r\\nthe latch, and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy\\r\\nwith the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the\\r\\nforecastle of an emigrant ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in\\r\\nstrange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back\\r\\nand chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark, lack-lustre eye\\r\\nturned upon the new-comer. Out of the black shadows there glimmered\\r\\nlittle red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as the burning\\r\\npoison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. The most lay\\r\\nsilent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked together in\\r\\na strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes,\\r\\nand then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own\\r\\nthoughts, and paying little heed to the words of his neighbor. At the\\r\\nfarther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside which on a\\r\\nthree-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old man, with his jaw\\r\\nresting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his knees, staring into\\r\\nthe fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for\\r\\nme and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I have not come to stay,” said I. “There is a friend of\\r\\nmine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and, peering\\r\\nthrough the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring\\r\\nout at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God! It’s Watson,” said he. He was in a pitiable state of reaction,\\r\\nwith every nerve in a twitter. “I say, Watson, what o’clock is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nearly eleven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of what day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of Friday, June 19th.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d’you\\r\\nwant to frighten a chap for?” He sank his face onto his arms, and began\\r\\nto sob in a high treble key.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting this two\\r\\ndays for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I am. But you’ve got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here a few\\r\\nhours, three pipes, four pipes—I forget how many. But I’ll go home\\r\\nwith you. I wouldn’t frighten Kate—poor little Kate. Give me your\\r\\nhand! Have you a cab?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have one waiting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe,\\r\\nWatson. I am all off color. I can do nothing for myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,\\r\\nholding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,\\r\\nand looking about for the manager. As I passed the tall man who sat\\r\\nby the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice\\r\\nwhispered, “Walk past me, and then look back at me.” The words fell\\r\\nquite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only have come\\r\\nfrom the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,\\r\\nvery thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down\\r\\nfrom between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude\\r\\nfrom his fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took\\r\\nall my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of\\r\\nastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but\\r\\nI. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had\\r\\nregained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire, and grinning at\\r\\nmy surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight\\r\\nmotion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half\\r\\nround to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped\\r\\nsenility.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes!” I whispered, “what on earth are you doing in this den?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As low as you can,” he answered; “I have excellent ears. If you would\\r\\nhave the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours I\\r\\nshould be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have a cab outside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he\\r\\nappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you\\r\\nalso to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have\\r\\nthrown in your lot with me. If you will wait outside, I shall be with\\r\\nyou in five minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes’s requests, for they\\r\\nwere always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet\\r\\nair of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined\\r\\nin the cab my mission was practically accomplished, and for the rest,\\r\\nI could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend\\r\\nin one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of\\r\\nhis existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney’s\\r\\nbill, led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness.\\r\\nIn a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium\\r\\nden, and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two\\r\\nstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. Then,\\r\\nglancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a\\r\\nhearty fit of laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose, Watson,” said he, “that you imagine that I have added\\r\\nopium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little\\r\\nweaknesses on which you have favored me with your medical views.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was certainly surprised to find you there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But not more so than I to find you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came to find a friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I to find an enemy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“An enemy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey.\\r\\nBriefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and\\r\\nI have hoped to find a clew in the incoherent ramblings of these\\r\\nsots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognized in that den my\\r\\nlife would not have been worth an hour’s purchase; for I have used it\\r\\nbefore now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has\\r\\nsworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of\\r\\nthat building, near the corner of Paul’s Wharf, which could tell some\\r\\nstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! You do not mean bodies?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aye, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had £1000 for every\\r\\npoor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is the vilest\\r\\nmurder-trap on the whole river-side, and I fear that Neville St. Clair\\r\\nhas entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here.”\\r\\nHe put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly—a\\r\\nsignal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance,\\r\\nfollowed shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses’\\r\\nhoofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson,” said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the\\r\\ngloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side\\r\\nlanterns. “You’ll come with me, won’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I can be of use.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.\\r\\nMy room at ‘The Cedars’ is a double-bedded one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The Cedars?’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair’s house. I am staying there while I conduct\\r\\nthe inquiry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is it, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am all in the dark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course you are. You’ll know all about it presently. Jump up here.\\r\\nAll right, John; we shall not need you. Here’s half a crown. Look out\\r\\nfor me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the\\r\\nendless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened\\r\\ngradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with\\r\\nthe murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull\\r\\nwilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,\\r\\nregular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some\\r\\nbelated party of revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the\\r\\nsky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts\\r\\nof the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his\\r\\nbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat beside\\r\\nhim, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax\\r\\nhis powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of\\r\\nhis thoughts. We had driven several miles, and were beginning to get\\r\\nto the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who\\r\\nhas satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have a grand gift of silence, Watson,” said he. “It makes you\\r\\nquite invaluable as a companion. ’Pon my word, it is a great thing\\r\\nfor me to have some one to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over\\r\\npleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman\\r\\nto-night when she meets me at the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You forget that I know nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get\\r\\nto Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow, I can get nothing\\r\\nto go upon. There’s plenty of thread, no doubt, but I can’t get the end\\r\\nof it into my hand. Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to\\r\\nyou, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Proceed, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some years ago—to be definite, in May, 1884—there came to Lee a\\r\\ngentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have plenty\\r\\nof money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely,\\r\\nand lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in the\\r\\nneighborhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer, by\\r\\nwhom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested\\r\\nin several companies, and went into town as a rule in the morning,\\r\\nreturning by the 5.14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is\\r\\nnow thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a good\\r\\nhusband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all\\r\\nwho know him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment,\\r\\nas far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to £88 10_s._, while\\r\\nhe has £220 standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank.\\r\\nThere is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been\\r\\nweighing upon his mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier\\r\\nthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important\\r\\ncommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a\\r\\nbox of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram\\r\\nupon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect\\r\\nthat a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting\\r\\nwas waiting for her at the offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.\\r\\nNow, if you are well up in your London, you will know that the offices\\r\\nof the company is in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam\\r\\nLane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch,\\r\\nstarted for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company’s\\r\\noffice, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4.35 walking\\r\\nthrough Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed\\r\\nme so far?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very clear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.\\r\\nClair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as\\r\\nshe did not like the neighborhood in which she found herself. While\\r\\nshe was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an\\r\\nejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down\\r\\nat her, and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor\\r\\nwindow. The window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she\\r\\ndescribes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically\\r\\nto her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed\\r\\nto her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from\\r\\nbehind. One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was\\r\\nthat, although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town\\r\\nin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS SHE MET THIS LASCAR\\r\\nSCOUNDREL.”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the\\r\\nsteps—for the house was none other than the opium den in which you\\r\\nfound me to-night—and, running through the front room, she attempted\\r\\nto ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At the foot of the\\r\\nstairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken,\\r\\nwho thrust her back, and, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there,\\r\\npushed her out into the street. Filled with the most maddening doubts\\r\\nand fears, she rushed down the lane, and, by rare good-fortune, met, in\\r\\nFresno Street, a number of constables with an inspector, all on their\\r\\nway to their beat. The inspector and two men accompanied her back, and,\\r\\nin spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their\\r\\nway to the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no\\r\\nsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one\\r\\nto be found, save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,\\r\\nmade his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one\\r\\nelse had been in the front room during the afternoon. So determined\\r\\nwas their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come\\r\\nto believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded, when, with a cry, she\\r\\nsprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table, and tore the lid\\r\\nfrom it. Out there fell a cascade of children’s bricks. It was the toy\\r\\nwhich he had promised to bring home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,\\r\\nmade the inspector realize that the matter was serious. The rooms were\\r\\ncarefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime.\\r\\nThe front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room, and led into a\\r\\nsmall bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves.\\r\\nBetween the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is\\r\\ndry at low tide, but is covered at high tide with at least four and\\r\\na half feet of water. The bedroom window was a broad one, and opened\\r\\nfrom below. On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the\\r\\nwindow-sill, and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden\\r\\nfloor of the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room\\r\\nwere all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of\\r\\nhis coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch—all were there.\\r\\nThere were no signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there\\r\\nwere no other traces of Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out of the window he\\r\\nmust apparently have gone, for no other exit could be discovered, and\\r\\nthe ominous blood-stains upon the sill gave little promise that he\\r\\ncould save himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at\\r\\nthe moment of the tragedy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in\\r\\nthe matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,\\r\\nbut as, by Mrs. St. Clair’s story, he was known to have been at the\\r\\nfoot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband’s appearance\\r\\nat the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the\\r\\ncrime. His defense was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that\\r\\nhe had no knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and\\r\\nthat he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing\\r\\ngentleman’s clothes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who lives\\r\\nupon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the\\r\\nlast human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name\\r\\nis Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every\\r\\nman who goes much to the city. He is a professional beggar, though,\\r\\nin order to avoid the police regulations, he pretends to a small\\r\\ntrade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street,\\r\\nupon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small\\r\\nangle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,\\r\\ncross-legged, with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and, as he is\\r\\na piteous spectacle, a small rain of charity descends into the greasy\\r\\nleather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the\\r\\nfellow more than once, before ever I thought of making his professional\\r\\nacquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has\\r\\nreaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that\\r\\nno one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a\\r\\npale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction,\\r\\nhas turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bull-dog chin, and a\\r\\npair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast\\r\\nto the color of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common\\r\\ncrowd of mendicants, and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready\\r\\nwith a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the\\r\\npassers-by. This is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger\\r\\nat the opium den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of\\r\\nwhom we are in quest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But a cripple!” said I. “What could he have done single-handed against\\r\\na man in the prime of life?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other\\r\\nrespects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. Surely your\\r\\nmedical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is\\r\\noften compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray continue your narrative.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,\\r\\nand she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence\\r\\ncould be of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton,\\r\\nwho had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the\\r\\npremises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the\\r\\nmatter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as\\r\\nhe was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated\\r\\nwith his friend the Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he\\r\\nwas seized and searched, without anything being found which could\\r\\nincriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his\\r\\nright shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been\\r\\ncut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,\\r\\nadding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the\\r\\nstains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same\\r\\nsource. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair,\\r\\nand swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much\\r\\na mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair’s assertion\\r\\nthat she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that\\r\\nshe must have been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly\\r\\nprotesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon\\r\\nthe premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh\\r\\nclew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had\\r\\nfeared to find. It was Neville St. Clair’s coat, and not Neville St.\\r\\nClair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And what do you think\\r\\nthey found in the pockets?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I don’t think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies\\r\\nand half-pennies—421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder\\r\\nthat it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a\\r\\ndifferent matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the\\r\\nhouse. It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when\\r\\nthe stripped body had been sucked away into the river.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.\\r\\nWould the body be dressed in a coat alone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that\\r\\nthis man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there\\r\\nis no human eye which could have seen the deed. What would he do then?\\r\\nIt would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the\\r\\ntell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of\\r\\nthrowing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not\\r\\nsink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle down-stairs when\\r\\nthe wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard\\r\\nfrom his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.\\r\\nThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret horde,\\r\\nwhere he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all\\r\\nthe coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure\\r\\nof the coat’s sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same\\r\\nwith the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and\\r\\nonly just had time to close the window when the police appeared.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It certainly sounds feasible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.\\r\\nBoone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but\\r\\nit could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against\\r\\nhim. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life\\r\\nappeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter\\r\\nstands at present, and the questions which have to be solved—what\\r\\nNeville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him\\r\\nwhen there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his\\r\\ndisappearance—are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I\\r\\ncannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first\\r\\nglance so simple, and yet which presented such difficulties.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of\\r\\nevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town\\r\\nuntil the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled\\r\\nalong with a country hedge upon either side of us. Just as he finished,\\r\\nhowever, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights\\r\\nstill glimmered in the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are on the outskirts of Lee,” said my companion. “We have touched\\r\\non three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex,\\r\\npassing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent. See that light\\r\\namong the trees? That is ‘The Cedars,’ and beside that lamp sits a\\r\\nwoman whose anxious ears have already, I have little doubt, caught the\\r\\nclink of our horse’s feet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. Mrs.\\r\\nSt. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may\\r\\nrest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend\\r\\nand colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have no news of her\\r\\nhusband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own\\r\\ngrounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse’s head, and, springing\\r\\ndown, I followed Holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to\\r\\nthe house. As we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde\\r\\nwoman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de\\r\\nsoie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She\\r\\nstood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand\\r\\nupon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly\\r\\nbent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a\\r\\nstanding question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” she cried, “well?” And then, seeing that there were two of\\r\\nus, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my\\r\\ncompanion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No good news?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No bad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have had a\\r\\nlong day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to me in\\r\\nseveral of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to\\r\\nbring him out and associate him with this investigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am delighted to see you,” said she, pressing my hand warmly.\\r\\n“You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our\\r\\narrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly\\r\\nupon us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear madam,” said I, “I am an old campaigner, and if I were not,\\r\\nI can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of any\\r\\nassistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed\\r\\nhappy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said the lady, as we entered a well-lit\\r\\ndining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,\\r\\n“I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to\\r\\nwhich I beg that you will give a plain answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, madam.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to\\r\\nfainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon what point?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. “Frankly,\\r\\nnow!” she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at\\r\\nhim as he leaned back in a basket-chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Frankly, then, madam, I do not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think that he is dead?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Murdered?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t say that. Perhaps.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And on what day did he meet his death?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On Monday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is\\r\\nthat I have received a letter from him to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanized.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” he roared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, to-day.” She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in\\r\\nthe air.\\r\\n\\r\\n“May I see it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon\\r\\nthe table, he drew over the lamp, and examined it intently. I had left\\r\\nmy chair, and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The envelope was a\\r\\nvery coarse one, and was stamped with the Gravesend post-mark, and with\\r\\nthe date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was\\r\\nconsiderably after midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Coarse writing,” murmured Holmes. “Surely this is not your husband’s\\r\\nwriting, madam.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but the enclosure is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and\\r\\ninquire as to the address.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you tell that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.\\r\\nThe rest is of the grayish color, which shows that blotting-paper has\\r\\nbeen used. If it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none\\r\\nwould be of a deep black shade. This man has written the name, and\\r\\nthere has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only\\r\\nmean that he was not familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but\\r\\nthere is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter.\\r\\nHa! there has been an enclosure here!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you are sure that this is your husband’s hand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of his hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing,\\r\\nand yet I know it well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a\\r\\nhuge error which it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in\\r\\npatience.—Neville.’ Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,\\r\\noctavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a man\\r\\nwith a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been gummed, if I am not very\\r\\nmuch in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. And you have\\r\\nno doubt that it is your husband’s hand, madam?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None. Neville wrote those words.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, the\\r\\nclouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the danger is\\r\\nover.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. The\\r\\nring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no; it is, it is, it is his very own writing!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday, and only\\r\\nposted to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If so, much may have happened between.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is well\\r\\nwith him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I should know if\\r\\nevil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself\\r\\nin the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room rushed up-stairs instantly\\r\\nwith the utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think\\r\\nthat I would respond to such a trifle, and yet be ignorant of his\\r\\ndeath?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may\\r\\nbe more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. And\\r\\nin this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to\\r\\ncorroborate your view. But if your husband is alive, and able to write\\r\\nletters, why should he remain away from you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very much so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the window open?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he might have called to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He might.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A call for help, you thought?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He waved his hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the\\r\\nunexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you thought he was pulled back?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He disappeared so suddenly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He might have leaped back. You did not see any one else in the room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the\\r\\nLascar was at the foot of the stairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary\\r\\nclothes on?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about which\\r\\nI wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little supper and\\r\\nthen retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our\\r\\ndisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary after\\r\\nmy night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when\\r\\nhe had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even\\r\\nfor a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts,\\r\\nlooking at it from every point of view, until he had either fathomed\\r\\nit, or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon\\r\\nevident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. He\\r\\ntook off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown,\\r\\nand then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and\\r\\ncushions from the sofa and arm-chairs. With these he constructed a sort\\r\\nof Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an\\r\\nounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.\\r\\nIn the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar\\r\\npipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the\\r\\nceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with\\r\\nthe light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I\\r\\ndropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me\\r\\nto wake up, and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment. The\\r\\npipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the\\r\\nroom was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap\\r\\nof shag which I had seen upon the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Awake, Watson?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Game for a morning drive?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the stable-boy\\r\\nsleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out.” He chuckled to himself\\r\\nas he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the\\r\\nsombre thinker of the previous night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was\\r\\nstirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished\\r\\nwhen Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the\\r\\nhorse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to test a little theory of mine,” said he, pulling on his\\r\\nboots. “I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the presence of\\r\\none of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from\\r\\nhere to Charing Cross. But I think I have the key of the affair now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where is it?” I asked, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the bath-room,” he answered. “Oh yes, I am not joking,” he\\r\\ncontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. “I have just been there, and\\r\\nI have taken it out, and I have got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on,\\r\\nmy boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe made our way down-stairs as quietly as possible, and out into the\\r\\nbright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and trap, with\\r\\nthe half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both sprang in, and\\r\\naway we dashed down the London Road. A few country carts were stirring,\\r\\nbearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on\\r\\neither side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has been in some points a singular case,” said Holmes, flicking the\\r\\nhorse on into a gallop. “I confess that I have been as blind as a mole,\\r\\nbut it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from\\r\\ntheir windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side.\\r\\nPassing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river, and\\r\\ndashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right, and found\\r\\nourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to the Force,\\r\\nand the two constables at the door saluted him. One of them held the\\r\\nhorse’s head while the other led us in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is on duty?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inspector Bradstreet, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?” A tall, stout official had come down the\\r\\nstone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. “I wish to\\r\\nhave a quiet word with you, Bradstreet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,\\r\\nand a telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his\\r\\ndesk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I called about that beggarman, Boone—the one who was charged with\\r\\nbeing concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I heard. You have him here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the cells.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he quiet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dirty?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is\\r\\nas black as a tinker’s. Well, when once his case has been settled, he\\r\\nwill have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you saw him, you would\\r\\nagree with me that he needed it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to see him very much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I think that I’ll take it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Come this way, if you please.” He led us down a passage,\\r\\nopened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a\\r\\nwhitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The third on the right is his,” said the inspector. “Here it is!” He\\r\\nquietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced\\r\\nthrough.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is asleep,” said he. “You can see him very well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his face\\r\\ntowards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. He was\\r\\na middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a colored\\r\\nshirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. He was, as the\\r\\ninspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his\\r\\nface could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an\\r\\nold scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction\\r\\nhad turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were\\r\\nexposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low\\r\\nover his eyes and forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s a beauty, isn’t he?” said the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He certainly needs a wash,” remarked Holmes. “I had an idea that he\\r\\nmight, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me.” He opened\\r\\nthe Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very\\r\\nlarge bath-sponge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He! he! You are a funny one,” chuckled the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very\\r\\nquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t know why not,” said the inspector. “He doesn’t look\\r\\na credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?” He slipped his key into\\r\\nthe lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The sleeper half\\r\\nturned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes\\r\\nstooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it\\r\\ntwice vigorously across and down the prisoner’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me introduce you,” he shouted, “to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of Lee,\\r\\nin the county of Kent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man’s face peeled off\\r\\nunder the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the coarse brown\\r\\ntint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and\\r\\nthe twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! A\\r\\ntwitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in\\r\\nhis bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and\\r\\nsmooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes, and staring about him with sleepy\\r\\nbewilderment. Then suddenly realizing the exposure, he broke into a\\r\\nscream, and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Great heavens!” cried the inspector, “it is, indeed, the missing man.\\r\\nI know him from the photograph.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself\\r\\nto his destiny. “Be it so,” said he. “And pray, what am I charged with?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With making away with Mr. Neville St.—— Oh, come, you can’t be\\r\\ncharged with that, unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it,”\\r\\nsaid the inspector, with a grin. “Well, I have been twenty-seven years\\r\\nin the force, but this really takes the cake.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has\\r\\nbeen committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally detained.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No crime, but a very great error has been committed,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“You would have done better to have trusted your wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was not the wife, it was the children,” groaned the prisoner. “God\\r\\nhelp me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My God! What an\\r\\nexposure! What can I do?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly\\r\\non the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up,” said he,\\r\\n“of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand, if you\\r\\nconvince the police authorities that there is no possible case against\\r\\nyou, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should\\r\\nfind their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure,\\r\\nmake notes upon anything which you might tell us, and submit it to the\\r\\nproper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless you!” cried the prisoner, passionately. “I would have\\r\\nendured imprisonment, aye, even execution, rather than have left my\\r\\nmiserable secret as a family blot to my children.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was\\r\\na school-master in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent\\r\\neducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally\\r\\nbecame a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor\\r\\nwished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis,\\r\\nand I volunteered to supply them. There was the point from which all\\r\\nmy adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur\\r\\nthat I could get the facts upon which to base my articles. When an\\r\\nactor I had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had\\r\\nbeen famous in the greenroom for my skill. I took advantage now of\\r\\nmy attainments. I painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as\\r\\npossible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist\\r\\nby the aid of a small slip of flesh-colored plaster. Then with a red\\r\\nhead of hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the\\r\\nbusiest part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller, but really as a\\r\\nbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned home in\\r\\nthe evening I found, to my surprise, that I had received no less than\\r\\n26_s._ 4_d._\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wrote my articles, and thought little more of the matter until, some\\r\\ntime later, I backed a bill for a friend, and had a writ served upon\\r\\nme for £25. I was at my wits’ end where to get the money, but a sudden\\r\\nidea came to me. I begged a fortnight’s grace from the creditor, asked\\r\\nfor a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the\\r\\ncity under my disguise. In ten days I had the money, and had paid the\\r\\ndebt.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous\\r\\nwork at £2 a week, when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by\\r\\nsmearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and\\r\\nsitting still. It was a long fight between my pride and the money,\\r\\nbut the dollars won at last, and I threw up reporting, and sat day\\r\\nafter day in the corner which I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my\\r\\nghastly face, and filling my pockets with coppers. Only one man knew\\r\\nmy secret. He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in\\r\\nSwandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar,\\r\\nand in the evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about\\r\\ntown. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that\\r\\nI knew that my secret was safe in his possession.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money.\\r\\nI do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn £700\\r\\na year—which is less than my average takings—but I had exceptional\\r\\nadvantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of\\r\\nrepartee, which improved by practice, and made me quite a recognized\\r\\ncharacter in the city. All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,\\r\\npoured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take\\r\\n£2.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,\\r\\nand eventually married, without any one having a suspicion as to my\\r\\nreal occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in the city. She\\r\\nlittle knew what.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last Monday I had finished for the day, and was dressing in my room\\r\\nabove the opium den, when I looked out of my window, and saw, to my\\r\\nhorror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with\\r\\nher eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms\\r\\nto cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated\\r\\nhim to prevent any one from coming up to me. I heard her voice\\r\\ndown-stairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off\\r\\nmy clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and\\r\\nwig. Even a wife’s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But\\r\\nthen it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and\\r\\nthat the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening\\r\\nby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the\\r\\nbedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by\\r\\nthe coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag\\r\\nin which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it\\r\\ndisappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but\\r\\nat that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few\\r\\nminutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead\\r\\nof being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his\\r\\nmurderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was\\r\\ndetermined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my\\r\\npreference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly\\r\\nanxious, I slipped off my ring, and confided it to the Lascar at a\\r\\nmoment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried\\r\\nscrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That note only reached her yesterday,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God! What a week she must have spent!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The police have watched this Lascar,” said Inspector Bradstreet, “and\\r\\nI can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter\\r\\nunobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who\\r\\nforgot all about it for some days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was it,” said Holmes, nodding approvingly; “I have no doubt of\\r\\nit. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many times; but what was a fine to me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It must stop here, however,” said Bradstreet. “If the police are to\\r\\nhush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be\\r\\ntaken. But if you are found again, then all must come out. I am sure,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared\\r\\nthe matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I reached this one,” said my friend, “by sitting upon five pillows and\\r\\nconsuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker\\r\\nStreet we shall just be in time for breakfast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure VII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning\\r\\nafter Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of\\r\\nthe season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown,\\r\\na pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled\\r\\nmorning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside the couch\\r\\nwas a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy\\r\\nand disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked\\r\\nin several places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the\\r\\nchair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the\\r\\npurpose of examination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are engaged,” said I; “perhaps I interrupt you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my\\r\\nresults. The matter is a perfectly trivial one” (he jerked his thumb in\\r\\nthe direction of the old hat), “but there are points in connection with\\r\\nit which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI seated myself in his arm-chair and warmed my hands before his\\r\\ncrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were\\r\\nthick with the ice crystals. “I suppose,” I remarked, “that, homely as\\r\\nit looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it—that it is\\r\\nthe clew which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the\\r\\npunishment of some crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no. No crime,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “Only one of\\r\\nthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have\\r\\nfour million human beings all jostling each other within the space of\\r\\na few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm\\r\\nof humanity, every possible combination of events may be expected to\\r\\ntake place, and many a little problem will be presented which may\\r\\nbe striking and bizarre without being criminal. We have already had\\r\\nexperience of such.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much so,” I remarked, “that of the last six cases which I have\\r\\nadded to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers,\\r\\nto the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the adventure of\\r\\nthe man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt that this small\\r\\nmatter will fall into the same innocent category. You know Peterson,\\r\\nthe commissionaire?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is to him that this trophy belongs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is his hat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no; he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look\\r\\nupon it, not as a battered billycock, but as an intellectual problem.\\r\\nAnd, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning,\\r\\nin company with a good fat goose, which is, I have no doubt, roasting\\r\\nat this moment in front of Peterson’s fire. The facts are these: about\\r\\nfour o’clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a\\r\\nvery honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification, and\\r\\nwas making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him\\r\\nhe saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger,\\r\\nand carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the\\r\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger and a\\r\\nlittle knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the man’s hat, on\\r\\nwhich he raised his stick to defend himself, and, swinging it over his\\r\\nhead, smashed the shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward\\r\\nto protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at\\r\\nhaving broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in\\r\\nuniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and\\r\\nvanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of\\r\\nTottenham Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of\\r\\nPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and\\r\\nalso of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a\\r\\nmost unimpeachable Christmas goose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which surely he restored to their owner?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that ‘For Mrs.\\r\\nHenry Baker’ was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird’s\\r\\nleft leg, and it is also true that the initials ‘H. B.’ are legible\\r\\nupon the lining of this hat; but as there are some thousands of Bakers,\\r\\nand some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy\\r\\nto restore lost property to any one of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, then, did Peterson do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,\\r\\nknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. The\\r\\ngoose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in\\r\\nspite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten\\r\\nwithout unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to\\r\\nfulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while I continue to retain the\\r\\nhat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did he not advertise?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only as much as we can deduce.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From his hat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather yourself as\\r\\nto the individuality of the man who has worn this article?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather\\r\\nruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,\\r\\nhard, and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of red silk, but\\r\\nwas a good deal discolored. There was no maker’s name; but, as Holmes\\r\\nhad remarked, the initials “H. B.” were scrawled upon one side. It was\\r\\npierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For\\r\\nthe rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several\\r\\nplaces, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the\\r\\ndiscolored patches by smearing them with ink.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can see nothing,” said I, handing it back to my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to\\r\\nreason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion\\r\\nwhich was characteristic of him. “It is perhaps less suggestive than\\r\\nit might have been,” he remarked, “and yet there are a few inferences\\r\\nwhich are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a\\r\\nstrong balance of probability. That the man was highly intellectual\\r\\nis of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly\\r\\nwell-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon\\r\\nevil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing\\r\\nto a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his\\r\\nfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at\\r\\nwork upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife\\r\\nhas ceased to love him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect,” he continued,\\r\\ndisregarding my remonstrance. “He is a man who leads a sedentary\\r\\nlife, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged,\\r\\nhas grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and\\r\\nwhich he anoints with lime-cream. These are the more patent facts which\\r\\nare to be deduced from his hat. Also, by-the-way, that it is extremely\\r\\nimprobable that he has gas laid on in his house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly joking, Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these\\r\\nresults, you are unable to see how they are attained?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no doubt that I am very stupid; but I must confess that I am\\r\\nunable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this man was\\r\\nintellectual?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right over the\\r\\nforehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. “It is a question\\r\\nof cubic capacity,” said he; “a man with so large a brain must have\\r\\nsomething in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The decline of his fortunes, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge came\\r\\nin then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the band of\\r\\nribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could afford to buy\\r\\nso expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he\\r\\nhas assuredly gone down in the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the foresight and\\r\\nthe moral retrogression?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes laughed. “Here is the foresight,” said he, putting\\r\\nhis finger upon the little disk and loop of the hat-securer. “They\\r\\nare never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a\\r\\ncertain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this\\r\\nprecaution against the wind. But since we see that he has broken the\\r\\nelastic, and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he\\r\\nhas less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a\\r\\nweakening nature. On the other hand, he has endeavored to conceal some\\r\\nof these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a\\r\\nsign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your reasoning is certainly plausible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,\\r\\nthat it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all\\r\\nto be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the\\r\\nlining. The lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by\\r\\nthe scissors of the barber. They all appear to be adhesive, and there\\r\\nis a distinct odor of lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not\\r\\nthe gritty, gray dust of the street, but the fluffy brown dust of the\\r\\nhouse, showing that it has been hung up in-doors most of the time;\\r\\nwhile the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the\\r\\nwearer perspired very freely, and could, therefore, hardly be in the\\r\\nbest of training.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But his wife—you said that she had ceased to love him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear\\r\\nWatson, with a week’s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your\\r\\nwife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also\\r\\nhave been unfortunate enough to lose your wife’s affection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he might be a bachelor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.\\r\\nRemember the card upon the bird’s leg.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that\\r\\nthe gas is not laid on in his house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I\\r\\nsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that\\r\\nthe individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning\\r\\ntallow—walks up-stairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and\\r\\na guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains\\r\\nfrom a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is very ingenious,” said I, laughing; “but since, as you said\\r\\njust now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done, save\\r\\nthe loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew\\r\\nopen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with\\r\\nflushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!” he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off through\\r\\nthe kitchen window?” Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get\\r\\na fairer view of the man’s excited face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!” He held out\\r\\nhis hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly\\r\\nscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of\\r\\nsuch purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the\\r\\ndark hollow of his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. “By Jove, Peterson!” said he,\\r\\n“this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you have got?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were\\r\\nputty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s more than a precious stone. It is _the_ precious stone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the Countess of Morcar’s blue carbuncle!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I have\\r\\nread the advertisement about it in _The Times_ every day lately. It\\r\\nis absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the\\r\\nreward offered of £1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of the\\r\\nmarket price.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!” The commissionaire plumped\\r\\ndown into a chair, and stared from one to the other of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are\\r\\nsentimental considerations in the background which would induce the\\r\\ncountess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the\\r\\ngem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was lost, if I remember aright, at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan,’” I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so, on December 22d, just five days ago. John Horner,\\r\\na plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady’s\\r\\njewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case has\\r\\nbeen referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the matter here,\\r\\nI believe.” He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,\\r\\nuntil at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the\\r\\nfollowing paragraph:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was\\r\\nbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22d inst. abstracted from\\r\\nthe jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the\\r\\nblue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his\\r\\nevidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room\\r\\nof the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery, in order that\\r\\nhe might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had\\r\\nremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called\\r\\naway. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that the\\r\\nbureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in\\r\\nwhich, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep\\r\\nher jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. Ryder instantly\\r\\ngave the alarm, and Horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone\\r\\ncould not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine\\r\\nCusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard Ryder’s cry of\\r\\ndismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,\\r\\nwhere she found matters as described by the last witness. Inspector\\r\\nBradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner, who\\r\\nstruggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest\\r\\nterms. Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given\\r\\nagainst the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with\\r\\nthe offence, but referred it to the Assizes. Horner, who had shown\\r\\nsigns of intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the\\r\\nconclusion, and was carried out of court.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! So much for the police-court,” said Holmes, thoughtfully, tossing\\r\\naside the paper. “The question for us now to solve is the sequence\\r\\nof events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of\\r\\na goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You see, Watson, our\\r\\nlittle deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less\\r\\ninnocent aspect. Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and\\r\\nthe goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat\\r\\nand all the other characteristics with which I have bored you. So now\\r\\nwe must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and\\r\\nascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do\\r\\nthis, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly\\r\\nin an advertisement in all the evening papers. If this fails, I shall\\r\\nhave recourse to other methods.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will you say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: ‘Found at the\\r\\ncorner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker\\r\\ncan have the same by applying at 6.30 this evening at 221B,\\r\\nBaker Street.’ That is clear and concise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very. But will he see it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,\\r\\nthe loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance\\r\\nin breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson, that he\\r\\nthought of nothing but flight; but since then he must have bitterly\\r\\nregretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird. Then, again,\\r\\nthe introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for every one\\r\\nwho knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson,\\r\\nrun down to the advertising agency, and have this put in the evening\\r\\npapers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In which, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, in the _Globe_, _Star_, _Pall Mall_, _St. James’s_, _Evening\\r\\nNews_, _Standard_, _Echo_, and any others that occur to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very well, sir. And this stone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say, Peterson,\\r\\njust buy a goose on your way back, and leave it here with me, for we\\r\\nmust have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your\\r\\nfamily is now devouring.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and held\\r\\nit against the light. “It’s a bonny thing,” said he. “Just see how it\\r\\nglints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.\\r\\nEvery good stone is. They are the devil’s pet baits. In the larger and\\r\\nolder jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not\\r\\nyet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in\\r\\nSouthern China, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the\\r\\ncarbuncle, save that it is blue in shade, instead of ruby red. In spite\\r\\nof its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two\\r\\nmurders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought\\r\\nabout for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.\\r\\nWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows\\r\\nand the prison? I’ll lock it up in my strong box now, and drop a line\\r\\nto the countess to say that we have it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had\\r\\nanything to do with the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely\\r\\ninnocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was\\r\\nof considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. That,\\r\\nhowever, I shall determine by a very simple test, if we have an answer\\r\\nto our advertisement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you can do nothing until then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come\\r\\nback in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I should like\\r\\nto see the solution of so tangled a business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe.\\r\\nBy-the-way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs.\\r\\nHudson to examine its crop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past\\r\\nsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached\\r\\nthe house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was\\r\\nbuttoned up to his chin, waiting outside in the bright semicircle which\\r\\nwas thrown from the fanlight. Just as I arrived, the door was opened,\\r\\nand we were shown up together to Holmes’s room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Henry Baker, I believe,” said he, rising from his arm-chair, and\\r\\ngreeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so\\r\\nreadily assume. “Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr. Baker. It is a\\r\\ncold night, and I observe that your circulation is more adapted for\\r\\nsummer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have just come at the right\\r\\ntime. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a large man, with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a\\r\\nbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled\\r\\nbrown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his\\r\\nextended hand, recalled Holmes’s surmise as to his habits. His rusty\\r\\nblack frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned\\r\\nup, and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of\\r\\ncuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words\\r\\nwith care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and\\r\\nletters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have retained these things for some days,” said Holmes, “because we\\r\\nexpected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at\\r\\na loss to know now why you did not advertise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. “Shillings have not been\\r\\nso plentiful with me as they once were,” he remarked. “I had no doubt\\r\\nthat the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat\\r\\nand the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt\\r\\nat recovering them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very naturally. By-the-way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To eat it!” Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it would have been of no use to any one had we not done so. But\\r\\nI presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the\\r\\nsame weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly, certainly;” answered Mr. Baker, with a sigh of relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your\\r\\nown bird, so if you wish—”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man burst into a hearty laugh. “They might be useful to me as\\r\\nrelics of my adventure,” said he, “but beyond that I can hardly see\\r\\nwhat use the _disjecta membra_ of my late acquaintance are going to be\\r\\nto me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I will confine my\\r\\nattentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the sideboard.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his\\r\\nshoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is your hat, then, and there your bird,” said he. “By-the-way,\\r\\nwould it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? I am\\r\\nsomewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a better grown\\r\\ngoose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, sir,” said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly-gained\\r\\nproperty under his arm. “There are a few of us who frequent the ‘Alpha\\r\\nInn,’ near the Museum—we are to be found in the Museum itself during\\r\\nthe day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name,\\r\\ninstituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence\\r\\nevery week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were\\r\\nduly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you,\\r\\nsir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.”\\r\\nWith a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and\\r\\nstrode off upon his way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much for Mr. Henry Baker,” said Holmes, when he had closed the door\\r\\nbehind him. “It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about\\r\\nthe matter. Are you hungry, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not particularly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper, and follow up\\r\\nthis clew while it is still hot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By all means.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats\\r\\nabout our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly in a\\r\\ncloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke\\r\\nlike so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly\\r\\nas we swung through the Doctors’ quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley\\r\\nStreet, and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter\\r\\nof an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the “Alpha Inn,” which is a small\\r\\npublic-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into\\r\\nHolborn. Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar, and ordered\\r\\ntwo glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My geese!” The man seemed surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was\\r\\na member of your goose club.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them’s not _our_ geese.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! Whose, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Breckinridge is his name.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I don’t know him. Well, here’s your good health, landlord, and\\r\\nprosperity to your house. Good-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now for Mr. Breckinridge,” he continued, buttoning up his coat, as we\\r\\ncame out into the frosty air. “Remember, Watson, that though we have\\r\\nso homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the\\r\\nother a man who will certainly get seven years’ penal servitude unless\\r\\nwe can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but\\r\\nconfirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation\\r\\nwhich has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has\\r\\nplaced in our hands. Let us follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to\\r\\nthe south, then, and quick march!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a zigzag\\r\\nof slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest stalls bore the\\r\\nname of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor, a horsey-looking man,\\r\\nwith a sharp face and trim side-whiskers, was helping a boy to put up\\r\\nthe shutters.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-evening. It’s a cold night,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salesman nodded, and shot a questioning glance at my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sold out of geese, I see,” continued Holmes, pointing at the bare\\r\\nslabs of marble.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let you have 500 to-morrow morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s no good.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, but I was recommended to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who by?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The landlord of the ‘Alpha.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?”\\r\\n\\r\\nTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, mister,” said he, with his head cocked and his arms\\r\\nakimbo, “what are you driving at? Let’s have it straight, now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the geese\\r\\nwhich you supplied to the ‘Alpha.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, I sha’n’t tell you. So now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don’t know why you should\\r\\nbe so warm over such a trifle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Warm! You’d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When\\r\\nI pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the\\r\\nbusiness; but it’s ‘Where are the geese?’ and ‘Who did you sell the\\r\\ngeese to?’ and ‘What will you take for the geese?’ One would think they\\r\\nwere the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been making\\r\\ninquiries,” said Holmes, carelessly. “If you won’t tell us the bet is\\r\\noff, that is all. But I’m always ready to back my opinion on a matter\\r\\nof fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, you’ve lost your fiver, for it’s town bred,” snapped the\\r\\nsalesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s nothing of the kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“D’you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled them\\r\\never since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that went to the\\r\\n‘Alpha’ were town bred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll never persuade me to believe that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you bet, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But I’ll\\r\\nhave a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salesman chuckled grimly. “Bring me the books, Bill,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great\\r\\ngreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now then, Mr. Cocksure,” said the salesman, “I thought that I was out\\r\\nof geese, but before I finish you’ll find that there is still one left\\r\\nin my shop. You see this little book?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the list of the folk from whom I buy. D’you see? Well, then,\\r\\nhere on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their\\r\\nnames are where their accounts are in the big ledger. Now, then!\\r\\nYou see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list of my town\\r\\nsuppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road—249,” read Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to the page indicated. “Here you are, ‘Mrs. Oakshott,\\r\\n117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, then, what’s the last entry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘December 22. Twenty-four geese at 7_s._ 6_d._’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. There you are. And underneath?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Sold to Mr. Windigate of the ‘Alpha,’ at 12_s._’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have you to say now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his\\r\\npocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of\\r\\na man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped\\r\\nunder a lamp-post, and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which\\r\\nwas peculiar to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the ‘pink ‘un’\\r\\nprotruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,” said\\r\\nhe. “I dare say that if I had put £100 down in front of him, that man\\r\\nwould not have given me such complete information as was drawn from\\r\\nhim by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we\\r\\nare, I fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which\\r\\nremains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs.\\r\\nOakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is\\r\\nclear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides\\r\\nourselves who are anxious about the matter, and I should—”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out\\r\\nfrom the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little\\r\\nrat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light\\r\\nwhich was thrown by the swinging lamp, while Breckinridge the salesman,\\r\\nframed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at the\\r\\ncringing figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve had enough of you and your geese,” he shouted. “I wish you were\\r\\nall at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more with your\\r\\nsilly talk I’ll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here and\\r\\nI’ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? Did I buy the geese\\r\\noff you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; but one of them was mine all the same,” whined the little man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She told me to ask you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I’ve had enough\\r\\nof it. Get out of this!” He rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer\\r\\nflitted away into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road,” whispered Holmes. “Come\\r\\nwith me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow.” Striding\\r\\nthrough the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring\\r\\nstalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him\\r\\nupon the shoulder. He sprang round, and I could see in the gaslight\\r\\nthat every vestige of color had been driven from his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, then? What do you want?” he asked, in a quavering voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse me,” said Holmes, blandly, “but I could not help\\r\\noverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. I\\r\\nthink that I could be of assistance to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other\\r\\npeople don’t know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you can know nothing of this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavoring to trace some\\r\\ngeese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton Road, to a salesman\\r\\nnamed Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, of the ‘Alpha,’\\r\\nand by him to his club, of which Mr. Henry Baker is a member.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet,” cried the\\r\\nlittle fellow, with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. “I can\\r\\nhardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. “In that case\\r\\nwe had better discuss it in a cosey room rather than in this windswept\\r\\nmarket-place,” said he. “But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it\\r\\nis that I have the pleasure of assisting.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man hesitated for an instant. “My name is John Robinson,” he\\r\\nanswered, with a sidelong glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no; the real name,” said Holmes, sweetly. “It is always awkward\\r\\ndoing business with an _alias_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. “Well, then,” said\\r\\nhe, “my real name is James Ryder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so. Head attendant at the ‘Hotel Cosmopolitan.’ Pray step\\r\\ninto the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you\\r\\nwould wish to know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with\\r\\nhalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he\\r\\nis on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. Then he stepped into\\r\\nthe cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker\\r\\nStreet. Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin\\r\\nbreathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of\\r\\nhis hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here we are!” said Holmes, cheerily, as we filed into the room. “The\\r\\nfire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder.\\r\\nPray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we\\r\\nsettle this little matter of yours. Now, then! You want to know what\\r\\nbecame of those geese?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine, in\\r\\nwhich you were interested—white, with a black bar across the tail.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder quivered with emotion. “Oh, sir,” he cried, “can you tell me\\r\\nwhere it went to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It came here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don’t wonder that you\\r\\nshould take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead—the\\r\\nbonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I have it here\\r\\nin my museum.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantel-piece with\\r\\nhis right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box, and held up the blue\\r\\ncarbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,\\r\\nmany-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain\\r\\nwhether to claim or to disown it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The game’s up, Ryder,” said Holmes, quietly. “Hold up, man, or you’ll\\r\\nbe into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He’s not\\r\\ngot blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. Give him a dash of\\r\\nbrandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to\\r\\nbe sure!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought\\r\\na tinge of color into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened\\r\\neyes at his accuser.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I could\\r\\npossibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. Still, that\\r\\nlittle may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. You had\\r\\nheard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar’s?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it,” said he, in a crackling\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see—her ladyship’s waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of sudden\\r\\nwealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for\\r\\nbetter men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means\\r\\nyou used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very\\r\\npretty villain in you. You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had\\r\\nbeen concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would\\r\\nrest the more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some\\r\\nsmall job in my lady’s room—you and your confederate Cusack—and you\\r\\nmanaged that he should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you\\r\\nrifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man\\r\\narrested. You then—”\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my\\r\\ncompanion’s knees. “For God’s sake, have mercy!” he shrieked. “Think\\r\\nof my father! of my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went\\r\\nwrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I’ll swear it on a Bible.\\r\\nOh, don’t bring it into court! For Christ’s sake, don’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get back into your chair!” said Holmes, sternly. “It is very well to\\r\\ncringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor Horner\\r\\nin the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the charge\\r\\nagainst him will break down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account of\\r\\nthe next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose\\r\\ninto the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope\\r\\nof safety.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘HAVE MERCY!’ HE SHRIEKED”]\\r\\n\\r\\nRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. “I will tell you it\\r\\njust as it happened, sir,” said he. “When Horner had been arrested, it\\r\\nseemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone\\r\\nat once, for I did not know at what moment the police might not take\\r\\nit into their heads to search me and my room. There was no place about\\r\\nthe hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission,\\r\\nand I made for my sister’s house. She had married a man named Oakshott,\\r\\nand lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.\\r\\nAll the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a\\r\\ndetective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring\\r\\ndown my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me what\\r\\nwas the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been\\r\\nupset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went into the back yard\\r\\nand smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just\\r\\nbeen serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, and fell\\r\\ninto talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what\\r\\nthey stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two\\r\\nthings about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where\\r\\nhe lived, and take him into my confidence. He would show me how to\\r\\nturn the stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought\\r\\nof the agonies I had gone through in coming from the hotel. I might\\r\\nat any moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone\\r\\nin my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time,\\r\\nand looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and\\r\\nsuddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the\\r\\nbest detective that ever lived.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of\\r\\nher geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she was always as\\r\\ngood as her word. I would take my goose now, and in it I would carry\\r\\nmy stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in the yard, and behind\\r\\nthis I drove one of the birds—a fine big one, white, with a barred\\r\\ntail. I caught it, and, prying its bill open, I thrust the stone down\\r\\nits throat as far as my finger could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I\\r\\nfelt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. But the\\r\\ncreature flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what\\r\\nwas the matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and\\r\\nfluttered off among the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?’ says she.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘you said you’d give me one for Christmas, and I was\\r\\nfeeling which was the fattest.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh,’ says she, ‘we’ve set yours aside for you—Jem’s bird, we call\\r\\nit. It’s the big white one over yonder. There’s twenty-six of them,\\r\\nwhich makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d\\r\\nrather have that one I was handling just now.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The other is a good three pound heavier,’ said she, ‘and we fattened\\r\\nit expressly for you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Never mind. I’ll have the other, and I’ll take it now,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, just as you like,’ said she, a little huffed. ‘Which is it you\\r\\nwant, then?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the\\r\\nflock.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird all the\\r\\nway to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a man that\\r\\nit was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked,\\r\\nand we got a knife and opened the goose. My heart turned to water, for\\r\\nthere was no sign of the stone, and I knew that some terrible mistake\\r\\nhad occurred. I left the bird, rushed back to my sister’s, and hurried\\r\\ninto the back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where are they all, Maggie?’ I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Gone to the dealer’s, Jem.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Which dealer’s?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But was there another with a barred tail?’ I asked, ‘the same as the\\r\\none I chose?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never tell\\r\\nthem apart.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my feet\\r\\nwould carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at\\r\\nonce, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You\\r\\nheard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like\\r\\nthat. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I\\r\\nam myself. And now—and now I am myself a branded thief, without ever\\r\\nhaving touched the wealth for which I sold my character. God help me!\\r\\nGod help me!” He burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in\\r\\nhis hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing, and by\\r\\nthe measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes’s finger-tips upon the edge of\\r\\nthe table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get out!” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, sir! Oh, heaven bless you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more words. Get out!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon the\\r\\nstairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls\\r\\nfrom the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“After all, Watson,” said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay\\r\\npipe, “I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. If\\r\\nHorner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will\\r\\nnot appear against him, and the case must collapse. I suppose that I am\\r\\ncommuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul.\\r\\nThis fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.\\r\\nSend him to jail now, and you make him a jail-bird for life. Besides,\\r\\nit is the season of forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most\\r\\nsingular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward.\\r\\nIf you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will\\r\\nbegin another investigation, in which, also, a bird will be the chief\\r\\nfeature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure VIII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\\r\\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\\r\\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\\r\\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\\r\\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\\r\\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\\r\\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\\r\\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\\r\\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\\r\\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It\\r\\nis possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\\r\\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\\r\\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\\r\\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\\r\\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are wide-spread\\r\\nrumors as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\\r\\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\\r\\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\\r\\na late riser as a rule, and as the clock on the mantel-piece showed\\r\\nme that it was only a quarter past seven, I blinked up at him in some\\r\\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\\r\\nregular in my habits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,” said he, “but it’s the common lot\\r\\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\\r\\nand I on you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then—a fire?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\\r\\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\\r\\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis\\r\\nat this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their\\r\\nbeds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\\r\\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\\r\\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\\r\\nshould call you and give you the chance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\\r\\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\\r\\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis, with which he\\r\\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\\r\\nmy clothes, and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\\r\\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\\r\\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-morning, madam,” said Holmes, cheerily. “My name is Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\\r\\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\\r\\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\\r\\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\\r\\nyou are shivering.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not cold which makes me shiver,” said the woman, in a low voice,\\r\\nchanging her seat as requested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.” She raised her veil as she\\r\\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\\r\\nagitation, her face all drawn and gray, with restless, frightened eyes,\\r\\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\\r\\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature gray, and her\\r\\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\\r\\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must not fear,” said he, soothingly, bending forward and patting\\r\\nher forearm. “We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\\r\\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know me, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\\r\\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\\r\\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady gave a violent start, and stared in bewilderment at my\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no mystery, my dear madam,” said he, smiling. “The left arm\\r\\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\\r\\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\\r\\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\\r\\nside of the driver.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,” said she. “I\\r\\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\\r\\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\\r\\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,\\r\\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\\r\\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\\r\\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\\r\\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\\r\\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\\r\\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\\r\\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\\r\\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not\\r\\nfind me ungrateful.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned to his desk, and unlocking it, drew out a small\\r\\ncase-book, which he consulted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Farintosh,” said he. “Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\\r\\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\\r\\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as\\r\\nI did to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\\r\\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\\r\\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\\r\\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\\r\\nmatter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alas!” replied our visitor, “the very horror of my situation lies\\r\\nin the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\\r\\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\\r\\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\\r\\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\\r\\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\\r\\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\\r\\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\\r\\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am all attention, madam.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my step-father, who is\\r\\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\\r\\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes nodded his head. “The name is familiar to me,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\\r\\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\\r\\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\\r\\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family\\r\\nruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the\\r\\nRegency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\\r\\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\\r\\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living\\r\\nthe horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\\r\\nstep-father, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\\r\\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\\r\\nmedical degree, and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\\r\\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice.\\r\\nIn a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\\r\\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death, and\\r\\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long\\r\\nterm of imprisonment, and afterwards returned to England a morose and\\r\\ndisappointed man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\\r\\nyoung widow of Major-general Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\\r\\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\\r\\nmy mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less\\r\\nthan £1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\\r\\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\\r\\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\\r\\nafter our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years\\r\\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\\r\\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London, and took us to\\r\\nlive with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money\\r\\nwhich my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed\\r\\nto be no obstacle to our happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But a terrible change came over our step-father about this time.\\r\\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who\\r\\nhad at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\\r\\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house, and seldom came\\r\\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\\r\\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\\r\\nthe men of the family, and in my step-father’s case it had, I believe,\\r\\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\\r\\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\\r\\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks\\r\\nwould fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\\r\\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\\r\\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\\r\\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\\r\\nfriends at all save the wandering gypsies, and he would give these\\r\\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\\r\\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\\r\\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\\r\\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\\r\\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\\r\\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds, and are feared by the\\r\\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\\r\\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\\r\\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\\r\\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\\r\\nas mine has.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your sister is dead, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\\r\\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\\r\\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\\r\\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss\\r\\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\\r\\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at\\r\\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines,\\r\\nto whom she became engaged. My step-father learned of the engagement\\r\\nwhen my sister returned, and offered no objection to the marriage; but\\r\\nwithin a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\\r\\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\\r\\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\\r\\nglanced across at his visitor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray be precise as to details,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\\r\\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\\r\\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\\r\\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\\r\\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second\\r\\nmy sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\\r\\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\\r\\nplain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perfectly so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\\r\\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\\r\\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of\\r\\nthe strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left\\r\\nher room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\\r\\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to\\r\\nleave me but she paused at the door and looked back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard any one whistle in\\r\\nthe dead of the night?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Never,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\\r\\nsleep?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly not. But why?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in\\r\\nthe morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it\\r\\nhas awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the\\r\\nnext room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\\r\\nwhether you had heard it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gypsies in the plantation.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\\r\\nnot hear it also.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at\\r\\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\\r\\nlock.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed,” said Holmes. “Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in\\r\\nat night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Always.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a\\r\\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\\r\\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\\r\\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\\r\\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\\r\\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\\r\\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\\r\\nwoman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,\\r\\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\\r\\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\\r\\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\\r\\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved\\r\\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\\r\\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\\r\\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\\r\\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\\r\\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\\r\\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\\r\\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\\r\\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognized me, but as I\\r\\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\\r\\nforget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There\\r\\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\\r\\nher finger into the air in the direction of the doctor’s room, but a\\r\\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\\r\\nloudly for my step-father, and I met him hastening from his room in his\\r\\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\\r\\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\\r\\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\\r\\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\\r\\nend of my beloved sister.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment,” said Holmes; “are you sure about this whistle and\\r\\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\\r\\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\\r\\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was your sister dressed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\\r\\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a matchbox.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\\r\\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\\r\\ncoroner come to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct\\r\\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\\r\\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had\\r\\nbeen fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\\r\\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\\r\\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\\r\\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\\r\\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\\r\\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\\r\\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How about poison?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The doctors examined her for it, but without success.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\\r\\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were there gypsies in the plantation at the time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there are nearly always some there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled\\r\\nband?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\\r\\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\\r\\nthese very gypsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\\r\\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\\r\\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These are very deep waters,” said he; “pray go on with your narrative.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\\r\\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\\r\\nknown for many years, has done me the honor to ask my hand in marriage.\\r\\nHis name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr. Armitage,\\r\\nof Crane Water, near Reading. My step-father has offered no opposition\\r\\nto the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring. Two\\r\\ndays ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building,\\r\\nand my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into\\r\\nthe chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\\r\\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night,\\r\\nas I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in\\r\\nthe silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of\\r\\nher own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be\\r\\nseen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I\\r\\ndressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart\\r\\nat the ‘Crown Inn,’ which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from\\r\\nwhence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you\\r\\nand asking your advice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have done wisely,” said my friend. “But have you told me all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your step-father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\\r\\nhand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the\\r\\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have been cruelly used,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady colored deeply and covered over her injured wrist. “He is a\\r\\nhard man,” she said, “and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\\r\\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a very deep business,” he said, at last. “There are a thousand\\r\\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\\r\\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\\r\\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\\r\\nwithout the knowledge of your step-father?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\\r\\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\\r\\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a house-keeper\\r\\nnow, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the\\r\\nway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\\r\\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there\\r\\nin time for your coming.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\\r\\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided\\r\\nmy trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\\r\\nafternoon.” She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\\r\\nfrom the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what do you think of it all, Watson?” asked Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nleaning back in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dark enough and sinister enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\\r\\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\\r\\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\\r\\nend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\\r\\npeculiar words of the dying woman?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\\r\\nband of gypsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\\r\\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\\r\\ninterest in preventing his step-daughter’s marriage, the dying allusion\\r\\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\\r\\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\\r\\nwhich secured the shutters falling back into their place, I think that\\r\\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\\r\\nthose lines.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what, then, did the gypsies do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see many objections to any such theory.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\\r\\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\\r\\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\\r\\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\\r\\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\\r\\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\\r\\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\\r\\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar\\r\\nof the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\\r\\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\\r\\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\\r\\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\\r\\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\\r\\nof prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which of you is Holmes?” asked this apparition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,” said my companion,\\r\\nquietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, doctor,” said Holmes, blandly. “Pray take a seat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will do nothing of the kind. My step-daughter has been here. I have\\r\\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a little cold for the time of the year,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has she been saying to you?” screamed the old man, furiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,” continued my\\r\\ncompanion, imperturbably.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! You put me off, do you?” said our new visitor, taking a step\\r\\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. “I know you, you scoundrel! I\\r\\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes, the busybody!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis smile broadened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes, the Scotland-yard Jack-in-office!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled heartily. “Your conversation is most entertaining,”\\r\\nsaid he. “When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\\r\\ndraught.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will go when I have said my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\\r\\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\\r\\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.” He stepped swiftly forward,\\r\\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See that you keep yourself out of my grip,” he snarled, and hurling\\r\\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace, he strode out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He seems a very amiable person,” said Holmes, laughing. “I am not\\r\\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\\r\\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.” As he spoke he picked up\\r\\nthe steel poker, and with a sudden effort straightened it out again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\\r\\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\\r\\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\\r\\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson,\\r\\nwe shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’\\r\\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\\r\\nmatter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\\r\\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\\r\\nwith notes and figures.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have seen the will of the deceased wife,” said he. “To determine\\r\\nits exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices\\r\\nof the investments with which it is concerned. The total income, which\\r\\nat the time of the wife’s death was little short of £1100, is now,\\r\\nthrough the fall in agricultural prices, not more than £750. Each\\r\\ndaughter can claim an income of £250, in case of marriage. It is\\r\\nevident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would\\r\\nhave had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\\r\\na very serious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it\\r\\nhas proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the\\r\\nway of anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\\r\\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\\r\\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\\r\\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\\r\\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument\\r\\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\\r\\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\\r\\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn, and drove for four or five\\r\\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with\\r\\na bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\\r\\nway-side hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and\\r\\nthe air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at\\r\\nleast there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the\\r\\nspring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion\\r\\nsat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\\r\\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest\\r\\nthought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and\\r\\npointed over the meadows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look there!” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavily-timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\\r\\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\\r\\nthe gray gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stoke Moran?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,” remarked the\\r\\ndriver.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is some building going on there,” said Holmes; “that is where we\\r\\nare going.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s the village,” said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\\r\\nsome distance to the left; “but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\\r\\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over\\r\\nthe fields. There it is, where the lady is walking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,” observed Holmes, shading his\\r\\neyes. “Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\\r\\nLeatherhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought it as well,” said Holmes, as we climbed the stile, “that\\r\\nthis fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some\\r\\ndefinite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.\\r\\nYou see that we have been as good as our word.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\\r\\nwhich spoke her joy. “I have been waiting so eagerly for you,” she\\r\\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. “All has turned out splendidly.\\r\\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\\r\\nbefore evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have had the pleasure of making the doctor’s acquaintance,” said\\r\\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\\r\\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” she cried, “he has followed me, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it appears.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\\r\\nhe say when he returns?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must guard himself, for he may find that there is some one more\\r\\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\\r\\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\\r\\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\\r\\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe building was of gray, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\\r\\nportion, and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out\\r\\non each side. In one of these wings the windows were broken, and\\r\\nblocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a\\r\\npicture of ruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but\\r\\nthe right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\\r\\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\\r\\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\\r\\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\\r\\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\\r\\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn, and examined with deep\\r\\nattention the outsides of the windows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\\r\\ncentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to\\r\\nDr. Roylott’s chamber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pending the alterations, as I understand. By-the-way, there does not\\r\\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\\r\\nroom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\\r\\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\\r\\nin it, of course?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for any one to pass through.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\\r\\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\\r\\nand bar your shutters.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through\\r\\nthe open window, endeavored in every way to force the shutter open,\\r\\nbut without success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\\r\\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\\r\\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. “Hum!”\\r\\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity; “my theory certainly\\r\\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\\r\\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\\r\\nmatter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\\r\\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber,\\r\\nso we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\\r\\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\\r\\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\\r\\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood\\r\\nin one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\\r\\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\\r\\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\\r\\nroom, save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards\\r\\nround and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so\\r\\nold and discolored that it may have dated from the original building of\\r\\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\\r\\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\\r\\nevery detail of the apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where does that bell communicate with?” he asked, at last, pointing to\\r\\na thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\\r\\nlying upon the pillow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It goes to the house-keeper’s room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It looks newer than the other things?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your sister asked for it, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\\r\\nwanted for ourselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\\r\\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\\r\\nfloor.” He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand,\\r\\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\\r\\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\\r\\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed, and spent\\r\\nsome time in staring at it, and in running his eye up and down the\\r\\nwall. Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s a dummy,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Won’t it ring?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\\r\\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\\r\\nopening for the ventilator is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How very absurd! I never noticed that before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very strange!” muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. “There are one or\\r\\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\\r\\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\\r\\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is also quite modern,” said the lady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Done about the same time as the bell-rope?” remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\\r\\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\\r\\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\\r\\ninner apartment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his\\r\\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\\r\\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an arm-chair\\r\\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\\r\\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\\r\\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\\r\\nkeenest interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s in here?” he asked, tapping the safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My step-father’s business papers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! you have seen inside, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There isn’t a cat in it, for example?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. What a strange idea!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, look at this!” He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\\r\\nthe top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\\r\\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I dare\\r\\nsay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.” He squatted\\r\\ndown in front of the wooden chair, and examined the seat of it with the\\r\\ngreatest attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. That is quite settled,” said he, rising and putting his\\r\\nlens in his pocket. “Hello! Here is something interesting!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog-lash hung on one\\r\\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself, and tied\\r\\nso as to make a loop of whip-cord.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world,\\r\\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of\\r\\nall. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\\r\\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it\\r\\nwas when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\\r\\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\\r\\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\\r\\nreverie.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very essential, Miss Stoner,” said he, “that you should\\r\\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall most certainly do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\\r\\nupon your compliance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I assure you that I am in your hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\\r\\nroom.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\\r\\ninn over there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is the ‘Crown.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\\r\\nwhen your step-father comes back. Then when you hear him retire for\\r\\nthe night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp,\\r\\nput your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\\r\\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\\r\\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\\r\\nthere for one night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, easily.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The rest you will leave in our hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what will you do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\\r\\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,” said\\r\\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I have.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then for pity’s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\\r\\ndied from some sudden fright.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘GOOD-BYE, AND BE BRAVE’”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\\r\\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you, for if Dr.\\r\\nRoylott returned and saw us, our journey would be in vain. Good-bye,\\r\\nand be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest\\r\\nassured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\\r\\nsitting-room at the “Crown Inn.” They were on the upper floor, and\\r\\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\\r\\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\\r\\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\\r\\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\\r\\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor’s\\r\\nvoice, and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\\r\\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\\r\\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said Holmes, as we sat together in the gathering\\r\\ndarkness, “I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\\r\\nis a distinct element of danger.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I be of assistance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your presence might be invaluable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall certainly come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very kind of you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\\r\\nwas visible to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\\r\\nyou saw all that I did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\\r\\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You saw the ventilator, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have\\r\\na small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\\r\\nhardly pass through.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\\r\\nMoran.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\\r\\ncould smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\\r\\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\\r\\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s\\r\\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what harm can there be in that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\\r\\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\\r\\nnot that strike you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot as yet see any connection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\\r\\nbefore?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot say that I have.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\\r\\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope—for so we may call\\r\\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\\r\\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong, he is\\r\\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\\r\\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\\r\\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\\r\\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\\r\\nover; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe, and turn our minds\\r\\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\\r\\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\\r\\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single\\r\\nbright light shone out right in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is our signal,” said Holmes, springing to his feet; “it comes\\r\\nfrom the middle window.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\\r\\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\\r\\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\\r\\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\\r\\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\\r\\nsombre errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\\r\\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees,\\r\\nwe reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\\r\\nwindow, when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\\r\\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\\r\\nwith writhing limbs, and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\\r\\ndarkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God!” I whispered; “did you see it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\\r\\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh, and put\\r\\nhis lips to my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a nice household,” he murmured. “That is the baboon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There was\\r\\na cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\\r\\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\\r\\nHolmes’s example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\\r\\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\\r\\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\\r\\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\\r\\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\\r\\nI could do to distinguish the words:\\r\\n\\r\\n“The least sound would be fatal to our plans.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\\r\\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\\r\\nyou in that chair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\\r\\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\\r\\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\\r\\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion\\r\\nsat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\\r\\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray\\r\\nof light, and we waited in absolute darkness. From outside came the\\r\\noccasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long\\r\\ndrawn cat-like whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at\\r\\nliberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock,\\r\\nwhich boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they seemed, those\\r\\nquarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat\\r\\nwaiting silently for whatever might befall.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\\r\\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by\\r\\na strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Some one in the next\\r\\nroom had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and\\r\\nthen all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half\\r\\nan hour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\\r\\naudible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\\r\\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\\r\\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\\r\\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see it, Watson?” he yelled. “You see it?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard\\r\\na low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\\r\\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\\r\\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale, and\\r\\nfilled with horror and loathing.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had ceased to strike, and was gazing up at the ventilator, when\\r\\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible\\r\\ncry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder and louder, a\\r\\nhoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful\\r\\nshriek. They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant\\r\\nparsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds. It struck cold\\r\\nto our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the\\r\\nlast echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can it mean?” I gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It means that it is all over,” Holmes answered. “And perhaps, after\\r\\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\\r\\nRoylott’s room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\\r\\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.\\r\\nThen he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\\r\\npistol in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\\r\\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam\\r\\nof light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\\r\\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott, clad in a long\\r\\ngray dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\\r\\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\\r\\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\\r\\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare\\r\\nat the corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\\r\\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\\r\\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The band! the speckled band!” whispered Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange head-gear began\\r\\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\\r\\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a swamp adder!” cried Holmes; “the deadliest snake in India. He\\r\\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\\r\\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\\r\\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and\\r\\nwe can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter, and let the\\r\\ncounty police know what has happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\\r\\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck, he drew it from its horrid\\r\\nperch, and carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\\r\\nwhich he closed upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\\r\\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\\r\\nalready run to too great a length, by telling how we broke the sad news\\r\\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\\r\\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\\r\\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\\r\\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\\r\\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\\r\\nback next day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had,” said he, “come to an entirely erroneous conclusion, which\\r\\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\\r\\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gypsies, and the use of the\\r\\nword ‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt to explain the\\r\\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\\r\\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\\r\\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\\r\\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened\\r\\nan occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the\\r\\ndoor. My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to\\r\\nyou, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the\\r\\nbed. The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped\\r\\nto the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\\r\\nthere as bridge for something passing through the hole, and coming\\r\\nto the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when\\r\\nI coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a\\r\\nsupply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right\\r\\ntrack. The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\\r\\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\\r\\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\\r\\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\\r\\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\\r\\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\\r\\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\\r\\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\\r\\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which\\r\\nwe saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\\r\\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\\r\\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\\r\\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\\r\\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room.\\r\\nAn inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\\r\\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\\r\\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\\r\\nand the loop of whip-cord were enough to finally dispel any doubts\\r\\nwhich may have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\\r\\nobviously caused by her step-father hastily closing the door of his\\r\\nsafe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know\\r\\nthe steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I\\r\\nheard the creature hiss, as I have no doubt that you did also, and I\\r\\ninstantly lit the light and attacked it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With the result of driving it through the ventilator.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\\r\\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home, and roused its\\r\\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\\r\\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s\\r\\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\\r\\nconscience.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure IX\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER’S THUMB\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes for solution during the years of our intimacy, there were only\\r\\ntwo which I was the means of introducing to his notice—that of Mr.\\r\\nHatherley’s thumb, and that of Colonel Warburton’s madness. Of these\\r\\nthe latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original\\r\\nobserver, but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic\\r\\nin its details, that it may be the more worthy of being placed upon\\r\\nrecord, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive\\r\\nmethods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The\\r\\nstory has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,\\r\\nlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set\\r\\nforth _en bloc_ in a single half-column of print than when the facts\\r\\nslowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears gradually\\r\\naway as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the\\r\\ncomplete truth. At the time the circumstances made a deep impression\\r\\nupon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the\\r\\neffect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the summer of ’89, not long after my marriage, that the\\r\\nevents occurred which I am now about to summarize. I had returned to\\r\\ncivil practice, and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street\\r\\nrooms, although I continually visited him, and occasionally even\\r\\npersuaded him to forego his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit\\r\\nus. My practice had steadily increased, and as I happened to live at\\r\\nno very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients\\r\\nfrom among the officials. One of these, whom I had cured of a painful\\r\\nand lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues, and\\r\\nof endeavoring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any\\r\\ninfluence.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne morning, at a little before seven o’clock, I was awakened by\\r\\nthe maid tapping at the door, to announce that two men had come\\r\\nfrom Paddington, and were waiting in the consulting-room. I dressed\\r\\nhurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom\\r\\ntrivial, and hastened down-stairs. As I descended, my old ally, the\\r\\nguard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got him here,” he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;\\r\\n“he’s all right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then?” I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some\\r\\nstrange creature which he had caged up in my room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a new patient,” he whispered. “I thought I’d bring him round\\r\\nmyself; then he couldn’t slip away. There he is, all safe and sound. I\\r\\nmust go now, doctor; I have my dooties, just the same as you.” And off\\r\\nhe went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.\\r\\n\\r\\nI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the\\r\\ntable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed, with a soft\\r\\ncloth cap, which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of his\\r\\nhands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with\\r\\nblood-stains. He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should\\r\\nsay, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale, and\\r\\ngave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong\\r\\nagitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor,” said he, “but I have\\r\\nhad a very serious accident during the night. I came in by train this\\r\\nmorning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a\\r\\ndoctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave the maid a\\r\\ncard, but I see that she has left it upon the side-table.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI took it up and glanced at it. “Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic\\r\\nengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3d floor).” That was the name,\\r\\nstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. “I regret that I have kept you\\r\\nwaiting,” said I, sitting down in my library-chair. “You are fresh\\r\\nfrom a night journey, I understand, which is in itself a monotonous\\r\\noccupation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my night could not be called monotonous,” said he, and laughed. He\\r\\nlaughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his\\r\\nchair and shaking his sides. All my medical instincts rose up against\\r\\nthat laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop it!” I cried; “pull yourself together!” and I poured out some\\r\\nwater from a caraffe.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical\\r\\noutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is\\r\\nover and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and\\r\\nblushing hotly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been making a fool of myself,” he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. Drink this.” I dashed some brandy into the water, and the\\r\\ncolor began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s better!” said he. “And now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly\\r\\nattend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even my\\r\\nhardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding\\r\\nfingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have\\r\\nbeen. It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” I cried, “this is a terrible injury. It must have bled\\r\\nconsiderably.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must have\\r\\nbeen senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was\\r\\nstill bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly\\r\\nround the wrist, and braced it up with a twig.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! You should have been a surgeon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own\\r\\nprovince.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This has been done,” said I, examining the wound, “by a very heavy and\\r\\nsharp instrument.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A thing like a cleaver,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An accident, I presume?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! a murderous attack?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very murderous indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You horrify me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it\\r\\nover with cotton wadding and carbolized bandages. He lay back without\\r\\nwincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is that?” I asked, when I had finished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man. I was\\r\\nvery weak, but I have had a good deal to go through.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently trying\\r\\nto your nerves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,\\r\\nbetween ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this\\r\\nwound of mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement; for\\r\\nit is a very extraordinary one, and I have not much in the way of proof\\r\\nwith which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clews which\\r\\nI can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will\\r\\nbe done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” cried I, “if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you\\r\\ndesire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my\\r\\nfriend Mr. Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I have heard of that fellow,” answered my visitor, “and I should\\r\\nbe very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course I must\\r\\nuse the official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to\\r\\nhim?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll do better. I’ll take you round to him myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be immensely obliged to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to have a\\r\\nlittle breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an\\r\\ninstant.” I rushed up-stairs, explained the matter shortly to my\\r\\nwife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new\\r\\nacquaintance to Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in\\r\\nhis dressing-gown, reading the agony column of _The Times_, and smoking\\r\\nhis before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and\\r\\ndottels left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried\\r\\nand collected on the corner of the mantel-piece. He received us in his\\r\\nquietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us\\r\\nin a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance\\r\\nupon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of\\r\\nbrandy-and-water within his reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr.\\r\\nHatherley,” said he. “Pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely\\r\\nat home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired, and keep up\\r\\nyour strength with a little stimulant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said my patient, “but I have felt another man since the\\r\\ndoctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has completed the\\r\\ncure. I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so I\\r\\nshall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat in his big arm-chair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression\\r\\nwhich veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat opposite to him,\\r\\nand we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor\\r\\ndetailed to us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must know,” said he, “that I am an orphan and a bachelor, residing\\r\\nalone in lodgings in London. By profession I am an hydraulic engineer,\\r\\nand I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven\\r\\nyears that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, the well-known\\r\\nfirm, of Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, and having\\r\\nalso come into a fair sum of money through my poor father’s death,\\r\\nI determined to start in business for myself, and took professional\\r\\nchambers in Victoria Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose that every one finds his first independent start in business\\r\\na dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two\\r\\nyears I have had three consultations and one small job, and that is\\r\\nabsolutely all that my profession has brought me. My gross takings\\r\\namount to £27 10_s._ Every day, from nine in the morning until four in\\r\\nthe afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began\\r\\nto sink, and I came to believe that I should never have any practice at\\r\\nall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office,\\r\\nmy clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to\\r\\nsee me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with the name of\\r\\n‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it. Close at his heels came the\\r\\ncolonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding\\r\\nthinness. I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man. His whole\\r\\nface sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks\\r\\nwas drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation\\r\\nseemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was\\r\\nbright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but\\r\\nneatly dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than\\r\\nthirty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Hatherley?’ said he, with something of a German accent. ‘You\\r\\nhave been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man who is not\\r\\nonly proficient in his profession, but is also discreet and capable of\\r\\npreserving a secret.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an\\r\\naddress. ‘May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at\\r\\nthis moment. I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan\\r\\nand a bachelor, and are residing alone in London.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That is quite correct,’ I answered, ‘but you will excuse me if\\r\\nI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional\\r\\nqualifications. I understood that it was on a professional matter that\\r\\nyou wished to speak to me?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to the\\r\\npoint. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy\\r\\nis quite essential—_absolute_ secrecy, you understand, and of course\\r\\nwe may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives\\r\\nin the bosom of his family.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘If I promise to keep a secret,’ said I, ‘you may absolutely depend\\r\\nupon my doing so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I had\\r\\nnever seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you promise, then?’ said he, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, I promise.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No reference\\r\\nto the matter at all, either in word or writing?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I have already given you my word.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Very good.’ He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across\\r\\nthe room, he flung open the door. The passage outside was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That’s all right,’ said he, coming back. ‘I know that clerks are\\r\\nsometimes curious as to their master’s affairs. Now we can talk in\\r\\nsafety.’ He drew up his chair very close to mine, and began to stare at\\r\\nme again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to\\r\\nrise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. Even\\r\\nmy dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my\\r\\nimpatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I beg that you will state your business, sir,’ said I; ‘my time is of\\r\\nvalue.’ Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to\\r\\nmy lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘How would fifty guineas for a night’s work suit you?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Most admirably.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I say a night’s work, but an hour’s would be nearer the mark. I\\r\\nsimply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has\\r\\ngot out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it\\r\\nright ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as that?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last train.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where to?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders of\\r\\nOxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a train from\\r\\nPaddington which would bring you there at about 11.15.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Very good.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There is a drive, then?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good seven\\r\\nmiles from Eyford Station.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would\\r\\nbe no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop the night.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense\\r\\nyou for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and\\r\\nunknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of\\r\\nyour profession. Still, of course, if you would like to draw out of\\r\\nthe business, there is plenty of time to do so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be\\r\\nto me. ‘Not at all,’ said I, ‘I shall be very happy to accommodate\\r\\nmyself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little\\r\\nmore clearly what it is that you wish me to do.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have\\r\\nexacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I have no wish to\\r\\ncommit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. I\\r\\nsuppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Entirely.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that\\r\\nfuller’s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one\\r\\nor two places in England?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I have heard so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Some little time ago I bought a small place—a very small\\r\\nplace—within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover\\r\\nthat there was a deposit of fuller’s-earth in one of my fields. On\\r\\nexamining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively\\r\\nsmall one, and that it formed a link between two very much larger ones\\r\\nupon the right and left—both of them, however, in the grounds of my\\r\\nneighbors. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land\\r\\ncontained that which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally,\\r\\nit was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true\\r\\nvalue; but, unfortunately, I had no capital by which I could do this. I\\r\\ntook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested\\r\\nthat we should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit, and\\r\\nthat in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy\\r\\nthe neighboring fields. This we have now been doing for some time, and\\r\\nin order to help us in our operations we erected an hydraulic press.\\r\\nThis press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we\\r\\nwish your advice upon the subject. We guard our secret very jealously,\\r\\nhowever, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers\\r\\ncoming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if\\r\\nthe facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these\\r\\nfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you promise\\r\\nme that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford\\r\\nto-night. I hope that I make it all plain?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I quite follow you,’ said I. ‘The only point which I could not\\r\\nquite understand, was what use you could make of an hydraulic press\\r\\nin excavating fuller’s-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out like\\r\\ngravel from a pit.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, carelessly, ‘we have our own process. We compress\\r\\nthe earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what\\r\\nthey are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully into my\\r\\nconfidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I trust you.’\\r\\nHe rose as he spoke. ‘I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11.15.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I shall certainly be there.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And not a word to a soul.’ He looked at me with a last, long,\\r\\nquestioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he\\r\\nhurried from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much\\r\\nastonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had\\r\\nbeen intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was glad, for the\\r\\nfee was at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price\\r\\nupon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead\\r\\nto other ones. On the other hand, the face and manner of my patron\\r\\nhad made an unpleasant impression upon me, and I could not think that\\r\\nhis explanation of the fuller’s-earth was sufficient to explain the\\r\\nnecessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I\\r\\nshould tell any one of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the\\r\\nwinds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off,\\r\\nhaving obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘NOT A WORD TO A SOUL’”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“At Reading I had to change not only my carriage, but my station.\\r\\nHowever, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I reached the\\r\\nlittle dim-lit station after eleven o’clock. I was the only passenger\\r\\nwho got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single\\r\\nsleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed out through the wicket gate,\\r\\nhowever, I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow\\r\\nupon the other side. Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me\\r\\ninto a carriage, the door of which was standing open. He drew up the\\r\\nwindows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as\\r\\nfast as the horse could go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One horse?” interjected Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, only one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you observe the color?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the\\r\\ncarriage. It was a chestnut.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tired-looking or fresh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, fresh and glossy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue your most\\r\\ninteresting statement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander\\r\\nStark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from\\r\\nthe rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that\\r\\nit must have been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence all the\\r\\ntime, and I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction,\\r\\nthat he was looking at me with great intensity. The country roads seem\\r\\nto be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and\\r\\njolted terribly. I tried to look out of the windows to see something of\\r\\nwhere we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make\\r\\nout nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now\\r\\nand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey,\\r\\nbut the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation\\r\\nsoon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged\\r\\nfor the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to\\r\\na stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after\\r\\nhim, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. We\\r\\nstepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so\\r\\nthat I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the\\r\\nhouse. The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed\\r\\nheavily behind us, and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the\\r\\ncarriage drove away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about\\r\\nlooking for matches, and muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door\\r\\nopened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light\\r\\nshot out in our direction. It grew broader, and a woman appeared with\\r\\na lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face\\r\\nforward and peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, and from\\r\\nthe gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that\\r\\nit was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a\\r\\ntone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a\\r\\ngruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from\\r\\nher hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,\\r\\nand then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he\\r\\nwalked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few\\r\\nminutes,’ said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little,\\r\\nplainly-furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which\\r\\nseveral German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down the lamp\\r\\non the top of a harmonium beside the door. ‘I shall not keep you\\r\\nwaiting an instant,’ said he, and vanished into the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance\\r\\nof German I could see that two of them were treatises on science, the\\r\\nothers being volumes of poetry. Then I walked across to the window,\\r\\nhoping that I might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak\\r\\nshutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully\\r\\nsilent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the\\r\\npassage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of\\r\\nuneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, and\\r\\nwhat were they doing, living in this strange, out-of-the-way place?\\r\\nAnd where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was\\r\\nall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea.\\r\\nFor that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns, were within\\r\\nthat radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. Yet it\\r\\nwas quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the\\r\\ncountry. I paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath\\r\\nto keep up my spirits, and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my\\r\\nfifty-guinea fee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter\\r\\nstillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman was\\r\\nstanding in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the\\r\\nyellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. I\\r\\ncould see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a\\r\\nchill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be\\r\\nsilent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken English at me, her\\r\\neyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom\\r\\nbehind her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I would go,’ said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak\\r\\ncalmly; ‘I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you\\r\\nto do.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But, madam,’ said I, ‘I have not yet done what I came for. I cannot\\r\\npossibly leave until I have seen the machine.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is not worth your while to wait,’ she went on. ‘You can pass\\r\\nthrough the door; no one hinders.’ And then, seeing that I smiled and\\r\\nshook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step\\r\\nforward, with her hands wrung together. ‘For the love of Heaven!’ she\\r\\nwhispered, ‘get away from here before it is too late!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage\\r\\nin an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I thought of my\\r\\nfifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night\\r\\nwhich seemed to be before me. Was it all to go for nothing? Why should\\r\\nI slink away without having carried out my commission, and without\\r\\nthe payment which was my due? This woman might, for all I knew, be a\\r\\nmonomaniac. With a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had\\r\\nshaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head, and\\r\\ndeclared my intention of remaining where I was. She was about to renew\\r\\nher entreaties, when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several\\r\\nfootsteps were heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant,\\r\\nthrew up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly\\r\\nand as noiselessly as she had come.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The new-comers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short, thick man with\\r\\na chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who\\r\\nwas introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘This is my secretary and manager,’ said the colonel. ‘By-the-way, I\\r\\nwas under the impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear\\r\\nthat you have felt the draught.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘On the contrary,’ said I, ‘I opened the door myself, because I felt\\r\\nthe room to be a little close.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. ‘Perhaps we had better\\r\\nproceed to business, then,’ said he. ‘Mr. Ferguson and I will take you\\r\\nup to see the machine.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I had better put my hat on, I suppose.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh no, it is in the house.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What, you dig fuller’s-earth in the house?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. All\\r\\nwe wish you to do is to examine the machine, and to let us know what is\\r\\nwrong with it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“We went up-stairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat\\r\\nmanager, and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house, with\\r\\ncorridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,\\r\\nthe thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had\\r\\ncrossed them. There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture\\r\\nabove the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls,\\r\\nand the damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried\\r\\nto put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten\\r\\nthe warnings of the lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a\\r\\nkeen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and\\r\\nsilent man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at\\r\\nleast a fellow-countryman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which he\\r\\nunlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three of us\\r\\ncould hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, and the\\r\\ncolonel ushered me in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it\\r\\nwould be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if any one were to\\r\\nturn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the\\r\\ndescending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon\\r\\nthis metal floor. There are small lateral columns of water outside\\r\\nwhich receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the\\r\\nmanner which is familiar to you. The machine goes readily enough, but\\r\\nthere is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little\\r\\nof its force. Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to\\r\\nshow us how we can set it right.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very thoroughly.\\r\\nIt was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous\\r\\npressure. When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers\\r\\nwhich controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there\\r\\nwas a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through\\r\\none of the side cylinders. An examination showed that one of the\\r\\nindia-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk\\r\\nso as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. This was\\r\\nclearly the cause of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my\\r\\ncompanions, who followed my remarks very carefully, and asked several\\r\\npractical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When\\r\\nI had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the\\r\\nmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was\\r\\nobvious at a glance that the story of the fuller’s-earth was the merest\\r\\nfabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an\\r\\nengine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. The walls were of\\r\\nwood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when I came\\r\\nto examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. I\\r\\nhad stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was, when I\\r\\nheard a muttered exclamation in German, and saw the cadaverous face of\\r\\nthe colonel looking down at me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What are you doing there?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that\\r\\nwhich he had told me. ‘I was admiring your fuller’s-earth,’ said I; ‘I\\r\\nthink that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if\\r\\nI knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my\\r\\nspeech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his gray\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Very well,’ said he, ‘you shall know all about the machine.’ He took\\r\\na step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the\\r\\nlock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite\\r\\nsecure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. ‘Hello!’\\r\\nI yelled. ‘Hello! Colonel! Let me out!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart\\r\\ninto my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish of the\\r\\nleaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp still stood\\r\\nupon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough. By its\\r\\nlight I saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,\\r\\njerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which\\r\\nmust within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself,\\r\\nscreaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. I\\r\\nimplored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the\\r\\nlevers drowned my cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my\\r\\nhead, and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface.\\r\\nThen it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend\\r\\nvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my face\\r\\nthe weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that\\r\\ndreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve\\r\\nto lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?\\r\\nAlready I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which\\r\\nbrought a gush of hope back to my heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls\\r\\nwere of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin\\r\\nline of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and\\r\\nbroadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could\\r\\nhardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.\\r\\nThe next instant I threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the\\r\\nother side. The panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the\\r\\nlamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,\\r\\ntold me how narrow had been my escape.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and I\\r\\nfound myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a\\r\\nwoman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held\\r\\na candle in her right. It was the same good friend whose warning I had\\r\\nso foolishly rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Come! come!’ she cried, breathlessly. ‘They will be here in a moment.\\r\\nThey will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste the so-precious\\r\\ntime, but come!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my\\r\\nfeet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. The\\r\\nlatter led to another broad passage, and, just as we reached it, we\\r\\nheard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one\\r\\nanswering the other, from the floor on which we were and from the one\\r\\nbeneath. My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her\\r\\nwits’ end. Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through\\r\\nthe window of which the moon was shining brightly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is your only chance,’ said she. ‘It is high, but it may be that\\r\\nyou can jump it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the\\r\\npassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark rushing\\r\\nforward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher’s\\r\\ncleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom, flung open the\\r\\nwindow, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden\\r\\nlooked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet\\r\\ndown. I clambered out upon the sill, but I hesitated to jump until I\\r\\nshould have heard what passed between my savior and the ruffian who\\r\\npursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to\\r\\ngo back to her assistance. The thought had hardly flashed through my\\r\\nmind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw\\r\\nher arms round him and tried to hold him back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Fritz! Fritz!’ she cried, in English, ‘remember your promise after\\r\\nthe last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh,\\r\\nhe will be silent!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You are mad, Elise!’ he shouted, struggling to break away from her.\\r\\n‘You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!’\\r\\nHe dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with\\r\\nhis heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to\\r\\nthe sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious of a dull pain, my grip\\r\\nloosened, and I fell into the garden below.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and\\r\\nrushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood\\r\\nthat I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I\\r\\nran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at\\r\\nmy hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time,\\r\\nsaw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from\\r\\nmy wound. I endeavored to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came\\r\\na sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint\\r\\namong the rose-bushes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been\\r\\na very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was\\r\\nbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with dew,\\r\\nand my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb.\\r\\nThe smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my\\r\\nnight’s adventure, and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I\\r\\nmight hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But, to my astonishment,\\r\\nwhen I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen.\\r\\nI had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high-road, and\\r\\njust a little lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my\\r\\napproaching it, to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the\\r\\nprevious night. Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that\\r\\nhad passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning train.\\r\\nThere would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The same porter\\r\\nwas on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired of\\r\\nhim whether he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark. The name was\\r\\nstrange to him. Had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for\\r\\nme? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was\\r\\none about three miles off.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined to\\r\\nwait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police. It\\r\\nwas a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to have my wound\\r\\ndressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I\\r\\nput the case into your hands, and shall do exactly what you advise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe both sat in silence for some little time after, listening to this\\r\\nextraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the\\r\\nshelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his\\r\\ncuttings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is an advertisement which will interest you,” said he. “It\\r\\nappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this: ‘Lost,\\r\\non the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, an hydraulic\\r\\nengineer. Left his lodgings at ten o’clock at night, and has not been\\r\\nheard of since. Was dressed in,’ etc., etc. Ha! That represents the\\r\\nlast time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I\\r\\nfancy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” cried my patient. “Then that explains what the girl\\r\\nsaid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and\\r\\ndesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand\\r\\nin the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will\\r\\nleave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is\\r\\nprecious, so if you feel equal to it, we shall go down to Scotland Yard\\r\\nat once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,\\r\\nbound from Reading to the little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard,\\r\\na plain-clothes man, and myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance\\r\\nmap of the county out upon the seat, and was busy with his compasses\\r\\ndrawing a circle with Eyford for its centre.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There you are,” said he. “That circle is drawn at a radius of ten\\r\\nmiles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere near that\\r\\nline. You said ten miles, I think, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was an hour’s good drive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were\\r\\nunconscious?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having been\\r\\nlifted and conveyed somewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I cannot understand,” said I, “is why they should have spared you\\r\\nwhen they found you lying fainting in the garden. Perhaps the villain\\r\\nwas softened by the woman’s entreaties.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, we shall soon clear up all that,” said Bradstreet. “Well, I have\\r\\ndrawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk\\r\\nthat we are in search of are to be found.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I could lay my finger on it,” said Holmes, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really, now!” cried the inspector, “you have formed your opinion!\\r\\nCome, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is south, for the\\r\\ncountry is more deserted there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I say east,” said my patient.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am for west,” remarked the plain-clothes man. “There are several\\r\\nquiet little villages up there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I am for north,” said I, “because there are no hills there, and\\r\\nour friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come,” cried the inspector, laughing; “it’s a very pretty diversity\\r\\nof opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do you give your\\r\\ncasting vote to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are all wrong.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we can’t _all_ be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, you can. This is my point;” he placed his finger in the centre\\r\\nof the circle. “This is where we shall find them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the twelve-mile drive?” gasped Hatherley.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the horse\\r\\nwas fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had\\r\\ngone twelve miles over heavy roads?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough,” observed Bradstreet,\\r\\nthoughtfully. “Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this\\r\\ngang.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None at all,” said Holmes. “They are coiners on a large scale, and\\r\\nhave used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of\\r\\nsilver.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,” said the\\r\\ninspector. “They have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. We\\r\\neven traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they\\r\\nhad covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old\\r\\nhands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we have got\\r\\nthem right enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined\\r\\nto fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we\\r\\nsaw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small\\r\\nclump of trees in the neighborhood, and hung like an immense ostrich\\r\\nfeather over the landscape.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A house on fire?” asked Bradstreet, as the train steamed off again on\\r\\nits way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir!” said the station-master.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did it break out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and\\r\\nthe whole place is in a blaze.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whose house is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Becher’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me,” broke in the engineer, “is Dr. Becher a German, very thin,\\r\\nwith a long, sharp nose?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master laughed heartily. “No, sir, Dr. Becher is an\\r\\nEnglishman, and there isn’t a man in the parish who has a better-lined\\r\\nwaistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as\\r\\nI understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good\\r\\nBerkshire beef would do him no harm.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all\\r\\nhastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low hill,\\r\\nand there was a great wide-spread whitewashed building in front of us,\\r\\nspouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front\\r\\nthree fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s it!” cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. “There is the\\r\\ngravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That second\\r\\nwindow is the one that I jumped from.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, at least,” said Holmes, “you have had your revenge upon them.\\r\\nThere can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was\\r\\ncrushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt\\r\\nthey were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.\\r\\nNow keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,\\r\\nthough I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Holmes’s fears came to be realized, for from that day to this no\\r\\nword has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister\\r\\nGerman, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met\\r\\na cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving\\r\\nrapidly in the direction of Reading, but there all traces of the\\r\\nfugitives disappeared, and even Holmes’s ingenuity failed ever to\\r\\ndiscover the least clew as to their whereabouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which\\r\\nthey had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed\\r\\nhuman thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. About sunset,\\r\\nhowever, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the\\r\\nflames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been\\r\\nreduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and\\r\\niron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our\\r\\nunfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin\\r\\nwere discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,\\r\\nwhich may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have\\r\\nbeen already referred to.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the\\r\\nspot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a\\r\\nmystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain\\r\\ntale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom\\r\\nhad remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. On the\\r\\nwhole, it was most probable that the silent Englishman, being less bold\\r\\nor less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear\\r\\nthe unconscious man out of the way of danger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said our engineer ruefully, as we took our seats to return once\\r\\nmore to London, “it has been a pretty business for me! I have lost my\\r\\nthumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have I gained?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Experience,” said Holmes, laughing. “Indirectly it may be of value,\\r\\nyou know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of\\r\\nbeing excellent company for the remainder of your existence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure X\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long\\r\\nceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which\\r\\nthe unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have eclipsed it,\\r\\nand their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this\\r\\nfour-year-old drama. As I have reason to believe, however, that the\\r\\nfull facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my\\r\\nfriend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter\\r\\nup, I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little\\r\\nsketch of this remarkable episode.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I was\\r\\nstill sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from\\r\\nan afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him.\\r\\nI had remained in-doors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden\\r\\nturn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which I\\r\\nhad brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign,\\r\\nthrobbed with dull persistency. With my body in one easy-chair and my\\r\\nlegs upon another, I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers,\\r\\nuntil at last, saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all\\r\\naside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the\\r\\nenvelope upon the table, and wondering lazily who my friend’s noble\\r\\ncorrespondent could be.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is a very fashionable epistle,” I remarked, as he entered. “Your\\r\\nmorning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger and a\\r\\ntide-waiter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety,” he\\r\\nanswered, smiling, “and the humbler are usually the more interesting.\\r\\nThis looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon\\r\\na man either to be bored or to lie.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest after all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not social, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, distinctly professional.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And from a noble client?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One of the highest in England.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I congratulate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my\\r\\nclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.\\r\\nIt is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this\\r\\nnew investigation. You have been reading the papers diligently of late,\\r\\nhave you not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It looks like it,” said I, ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the\\r\\ncorner. “I have had nothing else to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read\\r\\nnothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The latter is\\r\\nalways instructive. But if you have followed recent events so closely\\r\\nyou must have read about Lord St. Simon and his wedding?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, with the deepest interest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St.\\r\\nSimon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these\\r\\npapers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. This is what he\\r\\nsays:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “‘MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I\\r\\n  may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.\\r\\n  I have determined, therefore, to call upon you, and to consult\\r\\n  you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred\\r\\n  in connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard,\\r\\n  is acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees\\r\\n  no objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that\\r\\n  it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o’clock in\\r\\n  the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at\\r\\n  that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is\\r\\n  of paramount importance.    Yours faithfully,   ST. SIMON.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen, and the\\r\\nnoble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer\\r\\nside of his right little finger,” remarked Holmes, as he folded up the\\r\\nepistle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He says four o’clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the\\r\\nsubject. Turn over those papers, and arrange the extracts in their\\r\\norder of time, while I take a glance as to who our client is.” He\\r\\npicked a red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside\\r\\nthe mantel-piece. “Here he is,” said he, sitting down and flattening it\\r\\nout upon his knee. “Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second\\r\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral—Hum! Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief\\r\\nover a fess sable. Born in 1846. He’s forty-one years of age, which\\r\\nis mature for marriage. Was Undersecretary for the Colonies in a late\\r\\nAdministration. The Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for\\r\\nForeign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and\\r\\nTudor on the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive\\r\\nin all this. I think that I must turn to you, Watson, for something\\r\\nmore solid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have very little difficulty in finding what I want,” said I, “for\\r\\nthe facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. I\\r\\nfeared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry\\r\\non hand, and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture\\r\\nvan. That is quite cleared up now—though, indeed, it was obvious from\\r\\nthe first. Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal\\r\\ncolumn of _The Morning Post_, and dates, as you see, some weeks back.\\r\\n‘A marriage has been arranged,’ it says, ‘and will, if rumor is\\r\\ncorrect, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert St. Simon, second\\r\\nson of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only daughter of\\r\\nAloysius Doran, Esq., of San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.’ That is all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Terse and to the point,” remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin\\r\\nlegs towards the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers\\r\\nof the same week. Ah, here it is. ‘There will soon be a call for\\r\\nprotection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade principle\\r\\nappears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one the\\r\\nmanagement of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the\\r\\nhands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic. An important\\r\\naddition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes\\r\\nwhich have been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon,\\r\\nwho has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little\\r\\ngod’s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage\\r\\nwith Miss Hatty Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California\\r\\nmillionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face\\r\\nattracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an\\r\\nonly child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to\\r\\nconsiderably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future.\\r\\nAs it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled\\r\\nto sell his pictures within the last few years, and as Lord St. Simon\\r\\nhas no property of his own, save the small estate of Birchmoor, it\\r\\nis obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an\\r\\nalliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition\\r\\nfrom a Republican lady to a British peeress.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anything else?” asked Holmes, yawning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes; plenty. Then there is another note in _The Morning Post_ to\\r\\nsay that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would\\r\\nbe at St. George’s, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate\\r\\nfriends would be invited, and that the party would return to the\\r\\nfurnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr. Aloysius\\r\\nDoran. Two days later—that is, on Wednesday last—there is a curt\\r\\nannouncement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honey-moon\\r\\nwould be passed at Lord Backwater’s place, near Petersfield. Those are\\r\\nall the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Before the what?” asked Holmes, with a start.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The vanishing of the lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did she vanish, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the wedding breakfast.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite\\r\\ndramatic, in fact.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the\\r\\nhoney-moon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.\\r\\nPray let me have the details.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I warn you that they are very incomplete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps we may make them less so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning\\r\\npaper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is headed, ‘Singular\\r\\nOccurrence at a Fashionable Wedding’:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the\\r\\ngreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have\\r\\ntaken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as shortly\\r\\nannounced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;\\r\\nbut it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange\\r\\nrumors which have been so persistently floating about. In spite of\\r\\nthe attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public\\r\\nattention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served\\r\\nby affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The ceremony, which was performed at St. George’s, Hanover Square,\\r\\nwas a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the\\r\\nbride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral, Lord Backwater,\\r\\nLord Eustace, and Lady Clara St. Simon (the younger brother and sister\\r\\nof the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia Whittington. The whole party\\r\\nproceeded afterwards to the house of Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster\\r\\nGate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little\\r\\ntrouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained,\\r\\nwho endeavored to force her way into the house after the bridal party,\\r\\nalleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after\\r\\na painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and\\r\\nthe footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before\\r\\nthis unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,\\r\\nwhen she complained of a sudden indisposition, and retired to her room.\\r\\nHer prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed\\r\\nher, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber\\r\\nfor an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to\\r\\nthe passage. One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave\\r\\nthe house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his\\r\\nmistress, believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that\\r\\nhis daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with\\r\\nthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves into communication with\\r\\nthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will\\r\\nprobably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.\\r\\nUp to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to\\r\\nthe whereabouts of the missing lady. There are rumors of foul play in\\r\\nthe matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of\\r\\nthe woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that,\\r\\nfrom jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the\\r\\nstrange disappearance of the bride.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And is that all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a\\r\\nsuggestive one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it is—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has\\r\\nactually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a _danseuse_\\r\\nat the ‘Allegro,’ and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.\\r\\nThere are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands\\r\\nnow—so far as it has been set forth in the public press.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not have\\r\\nmissed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell, Watson, and as\\r\\nthe clock makes it a few minutes after four, I have no doubt that this\\r\\nwill prove to be our noble client. Do not dream of going, Watson, for I\\r\\nvery much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lord Robert St. Simon,” announced our page-boy, throwing open the\\r\\ndoor. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed\\r\\nand pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and\\r\\nwith the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had\\r\\never been to command and to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, and yet\\r\\nhis general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a\\r\\nslight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. His\\r\\nhair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled\\r\\nround the edges and thin upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful\\r\\nto the verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white\\r\\nwaistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-colored\\r\\ngaiters. He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left\\r\\nto right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden\\r\\neye-glasses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-day, Lord St. Simon,” said Holmes, rising and bowing. “Pray take\\r\\nthe basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up\\r\\na little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you have\\r\\nalready managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though I\\r\\npresume that they were hardly from the same class of society.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I am descending.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I beg pardon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My last client of the sort was a king.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The King of Scandinavia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! Had he lost his wife?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can understand,” said Holmes, suavely, “that I extend to the\\r\\naffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to you in\\r\\nyours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course! Very right! very right! I’m sure I beg pardon. As to my own\\r\\ncase, I am ready to give you any information which may assist you in\\r\\nforming an opinion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public prints,\\r\\nnothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct—this article,\\r\\nfor example, as to the disappearance of the bride.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon glanced over it. “Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it needs a great deal of supplementing before any one could offer\\r\\nan opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by\\r\\nquestioning you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In San Francisco, a year ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were travelling in the States?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you become engaged then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you were on a friendly footing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was amused.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Her father is very rich?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did he make his money?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,\\r\\ninvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady’s—your wife’s\\r\\ncharacter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the\\r\\nfire. “You see, Mr. Holmes,” said he, “my wife was twenty before her\\r\\nfather became a rich man. During that time she ran free in a mining\\r\\ncamp, and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education\\r\\nhas come from Nature rather than from the school-master. She is what\\r\\nwe call in England a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free,\\r\\nunfettered by any sort of traditions. She is impetuous—volcanic, I\\r\\nwas about to say. She is swift in making up her mind, and fearless\\r\\nin carrying out her resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have\\r\\ngiven her the name which I have the honor to bear”—he gave a little\\r\\nstately cough—“had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I\\r\\nbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice, and that anything\\r\\ndishonorable would be repugnant to her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you her photograph?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I brought this with me.” He opened a locket, and showed us the full\\r\\nface of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph, but an ivory\\r\\nminiature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the\\r\\nlustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.\\r\\nHolmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he closed the locket and\\r\\nhanded it back to Lord St. Simon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your\\r\\nacquaintance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met\\r\\nher several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a _fait\\r\\naccompli_?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really have made no inquiries on the subject.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the\\r\\nwedding?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was she in good spirits?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future\\r\\nlives.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the wedding?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was as bright as possible—at least, until after the ceremony.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And did you observe any change in her then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever\\r\\nseen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident, however,\\r\\nwas too trivial to relate, and can have no possible bearing upon the\\r\\ncase.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray let us have it, for all that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the\\r\\nvestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over\\r\\ninto the pew. There was a moment’s delay, but the gentleman in the\\r\\npew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse\\r\\nfor the fall. Yet, when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me\\r\\nabruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly\\r\\nagitated over this trifling cause.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of the\\r\\ngeneral public were present, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman was not one of your wife’s friends?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a\\r\\ncommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I\\r\\nthink that we are wandering rather far from the point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful\\r\\nframe of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering\\r\\nher father’s house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw her in conversation with her maid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who is her maid?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Alice is her name. She is an American, and came from California with\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A confidential servant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to\\r\\ntake great liberties. Still, of course, in America they look upon these\\r\\nthings in a different way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long did she speak to this Alice?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not overhear what they said?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lady St. Simon said something about ‘jumping a claim.’ She was\\r\\naccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she meant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your wife do\\r\\nwhen she finished speaking to her maid?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She walked into the breakfast-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On your arm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.\\r\\nThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,\\r\\nmuttered some words of apology, and left the room. She never came back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her\\r\\nroom, covered her bride’s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,\\r\\nand went out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in\\r\\ncompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had\\r\\nalready made a disturbance at Mr. Doran’s house that morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and\\r\\nyour relations to her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. “We\\r\\nhave been on a friendly footing for some years—I may say on a _very_\\r\\nfriendly footing. She used to be at the ‘Allegro.’ I have not treated\\r\\nher ungenerously, and she has no just cause of complaint against me;\\r\\nbut you know what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing,\\r\\nbut exceedingly hot-headed, and devotedly attached to me. She wrote me\\r\\ndreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married; and, to\\r\\ntell the truth, the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly\\r\\nwas that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came\\r\\nto Mr. Doran’s door just after we returned, and she endeavored to push\\r\\nher way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even\\r\\nthreatening her, but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the\\r\\nsort, and I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon\\r\\npushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good\\r\\nin making a row.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did your wife hear all this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thank goodness, she did not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as so\\r\\nserious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out, and laid some\\r\\nterrible trap for her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is a possible supposition.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think so, too?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this\\r\\nas likely?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not think Flora would hurt a fly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is\\r\\nyour own theory as to what took place?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I have\\r\\ngiven you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it\\r\\nhas occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the\\r\\nconsciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the\\r\\neffect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back—I will\\r\\nnot say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without\\r\\nsuccess—I can hardly explain it in any other fashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis,” said Holmes,\\r\\nsmiling. “And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have nearly all my\\r\\ndata. May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that\\r\\nyou could see out of the window?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We could see the other side of the road and the Park.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I\\r\\nshall communicate with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem,” said our\\r\\nclient, rising.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have solved it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eh? What was that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I say that I have solved it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where, then, is my wife?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is a detail which I shall speedily supply.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon shook his head. “I am afraid that it will take wiser\\r\\nheads than yours or mine,” he remarked, and bowing in a stately,\\r\\nold-fashioned manner, he departed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honor my head by putting it\\r\\non a level with his own,” said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. “I think\\r\\nthat I shall have a whiskey-and-soda and a cigar after all this\\r\\ncross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the case before\\r\\nour client came into the room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I remarked\\r\\nbefore, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to\\r\\nturn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is\\r\\noccasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to\\r\\nquote Thoreau’s example.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I have heard all that you have heard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me\\r\\nso well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back,\\r\\nand something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the\\r\\nFranco-Prussian war. It is one of these cases—but, hello, here is\\r\\nLestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon\\r\\nthe sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which\\r\\ngave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas\\r\\nbag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the\\r\\ncigar which had been offered to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s up, then?” asked Holmes, with a twinkle in his eye. “You look\\r\\ndissatisfied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case.\\r\\nI can make neither head nor tail of the business.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really! You surprise me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clew seems to slip\\r\\nthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And very wet it seems to have made you,” said Holmes, laying his hand\\r\\nupon the arm of the pea-jacket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In Heaven’s name, what for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In search of the body of Lady St. Simon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why? What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one\\r\\nas in the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. “I suppose you know all\\r\\nabout it,” he snarled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the\\r\\nmatter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it very unlikely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this\\r\\nin it?” He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a\\r\\nwedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes, and a\\r\\nbride’s wreath and veil, all discolored and soaked in water. “There,”\\r\\nsaid he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. “There is\\r\\na little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed!” said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. “You\\r\\ndragged them from the Serpentine?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. They\\r\\nhave been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the\\r\\nclothes were there the body would not be far off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the same brilliant reasoning, every man’s body is to be found in\\r\\nthe neighborhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope to arrive\\r\\nat through this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid that you will find it difficult.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you, indeed, now?” cried Lestrade, with some bitterness. “I am\\r\\nafraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions\\r\\nand your inferences. You have made two blunders in as many minutes.\\r\\nThis dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the\\r\\ncard-case is a note. And here is the very note.” He slapped it down\\r\\nupon the table in front of him. “Listen to this: ‘You will see me when\\r\\nall is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.’ Now my theory all along has been\\r\\nthat Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, and that she,\\r\\nwith confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.\\r\\nHere, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt\\r\\nquietly slipped into her hand at the door, and which lured her within\\r\\ntheir reach.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, Lestrade,” said Holmes, laughing. “You really are very fine\\r\\nindeed. Let me see it.” He took up the paper in a listless way, but\\r\\nhis attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of\\r\\nsatisfaction. “This is indeed important,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! you find it so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. “Why,” he\\r\\nshrieked, “you’re looking at the wrong side!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, this is the right side.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The right side? You’re mad! Here is the note written in pencil over\\r\\nhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,\\r\\nwhich interests me deeply.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s nothing in it. I looked at it before,” said Lestrade. “‘Oct.\\r\\n4th, rooms 8_s._, breakfast 2_s._ 6_d._, cocktail 1_s._, lunch 2_s._\\r\\n6_d._, glass sherry, 8_d._’ I see nothing in that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the note,\\r\\nit is important also, or at least the initials are, so I congratulate\\r\\nyou again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve wasted time enough,” said Lestrade, rising. “I believe in hard\\r\\nwork, and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. Good-day,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter\\r\\nfirst.” He gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made\\r\\nfor the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just one hint to you, Lestrade,” drawled Holmes, before his rival\\r\\nvanished; “I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady St.\\r\\nSimon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any such\\r\\nperson.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped\\r\\nhis forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose and put on his\\r\\novercoat. “There is something in what the fellow says about out-door\\r\\nwork,” he remarked, “so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your\\r\\npapers for a little.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was after five o’clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no\\r\\ntime to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner’s\\r\\nman with a very large flat box. This he unpacked with the help of a\\r\\nyouth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great\\r\\nastonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out\\r\\nupon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of\\r\\ncold woodcock, a pheasant, a _pâté de foie gras_ pie, with a group of\\r\\nancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries, my\\r\\ntwo visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian Nights, with\\r\\nno explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered\\r\\nto this address.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust before nine o’clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room.\\r\\nHis features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which\\r\\nmade me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They have laid the supper, then,” he said, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to expect company. They have laid for five.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in,” said he. “I am\\r\\nsurprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that\\r\\nI hear his step now upon the stairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed our visitor of the morning who came bustling in, dangling\\r\\nhis glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very perturbed\\r\\nexpression upon his aristocratic features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My messenger reached you, then?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. Have\\r\\nyou good authority for what you say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The best possible.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What will the duke say,” he murmured, “when he hears that one of the\\r\\nfamily has been subjected to such humiliation?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any\\r\\nhumiliation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you look on these things from another stand-point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fail to see that any one is to blame. I can hardly see how the lady\\r\\ncould have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was\\r\\nundoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise\\r\\nher at such a crisis.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a slight, sir, a public slight,” said Lord St. Simon, tapping\\r\\nhis fingers upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented\\r\\na position.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have been\\r\\nshamefully used.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I heard a ring,” said Holmes. “Yes, there are steps on\\r\\nthe landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the\\r\\nmatter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here who may be more\\r\\nsuccessful.” He opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.\\r\\n“Lord St. Simon,” said he, “allow me to introduce you to Mr. and Mrs.\\r\\nFrancis Hay Moulton. The lady, I think, you have already met.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the sight of these new-comers our client had sprung from his seat\\r\\nand stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into\\r\\nthe breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. The lady\\r\\nhad taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but\\r\\nhe still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution,\\r\\nperhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re angry, Robert,” said she. “Well, I guess you have every cause\\r\\nto be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray make no apology to me,” said Lord St. Simon, bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, I know that I have treated you real bad, and that I should\\r\\nhave spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of rattled, and from\\r\\nthe time when I saw Frank here again I just didn’t know what I was\\r\\ndoing or saying. I only wonder I didn’t fall down and do a faint right\\r\\nthere before the altar.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the\\r\\nroom while you explain this matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If I may give an opinion,” remarked the strange gentleman, “we’ve had\\r\\njust a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part,\\r\\nI should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it.” He was\\r\\na small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean shaven, with a sharp face and alert\\r\\nmanner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I’ll tell our story right away,” said the lady. “Frank here and I\\r\\nmet in ’84, in McQuire’s camp, near the Rockies, where pa was working\\r\\na claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day\\r\\nfather struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had\\r\\na claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew, the\\r\\npoorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn’t hear of our engagement lasting\\r\\nany longer, and he took me away to ’Frisco. Frank wouldn’t throw up\\r\\nhis hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa\\r\\nknowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so\\r\\nwe just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and\\r\\nmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as\\r\\nmuch as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time, and\\r\\npledged myself not to marry any one else while he lived. ‘Why shouldn’t\\r\\nwe be married right away, then,’ said he, ‘and then I will feel sure of\\r\\nyou; and I won’t claim to be your husband until I come back?’ Well, we\\r\\ntalked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman\\r\\nall ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then Frank\\r\\nwent off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then he went\\r\\nprospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New Mexico. After\\r\\nthat came a long newspaper story about how a miners’ camp had been\\r\\nattacked by Apache Indians, and there was my Frank’s name among the\\r\\nkilled. I fainted dead away, and I was very sick for months after. Pa\\r\\nthought I had a decline, and took me to half the doctors in ’Frisco.\\r\\nNot a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted\\r\\nthat Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to ’Frisco, and we\\r\\ncame to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased,\\r\\nbut I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the\\r\\nplace in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I’d have done my\\r\\nduty by him. We can’t command our love, but we can our actions. I went\\r\\nto the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a\\r\\nwife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just\\r\\nas I came to the altar rails, I glanced back and saw Frank standing\\r\\nand looking at me out of the first pew. I thought it was his ghost at\\r\\nfirst; but when I looked again, there he was still, with a kind of\\r\\nquestion in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to\\r\\nsee him. I wonder I didn’t drop. I know that everything was turning\\r\\nround, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee\\r\\nin my ear. I didn’t know what to do. Should I stop the service and make\\r\\na scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to know\\r\\nwhat I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to\\r\\nbe still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and I knew that\\r\\nhe was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped\\r\\nmy bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he\\r\\nreturned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when\\r\\nhe made the sign to me to do so. Of course I never doubted for a moment\\r\\nthat my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do just whatever\\r\\nhe might direct.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, and\\r\\nhad always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a\\r\\nfew things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to have spoken\\r\\nto Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all\\r\\nthose great people. I just made up my mind to run away and explain\\r\\nafterwards. I hadn’t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank\\r\\nout of the window at the other side of the road. He beckoned to me, and\\r\\nthen began walking into the Park. I slipped out, put on my things, and\\r\\nfollowed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord\\r\\nSt. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a\\r\\nlittle secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get\\r\\naway from her, and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and\\r\\naway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and that\\r\\nwas my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank had been a\\r\\nprisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to ’Frisco, found that\\r\\nI had given him up for dead and had gone to England, followed me there,\\r\\nand had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw it in a paper,” explained the American. “It gave the name and\\r\\nthe church, but not where the lady lived.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all for\\r\\nopenness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should\\r\\nlike to vanish away and never see any of them again—just sending\\r\\na line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful\\r\\nto me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that\\r\\nbreakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my\\r\\nwedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should\\r\\nnot be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find\\r\\nthem. It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only\\r\\nthat this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening,\\r\\nthough how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very\\r\\nclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that\\r\\nwe should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. Then\\r\\nhe offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St. Simon alone, and\\r\\nso we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you have\\r\\nheard it all, and I am very sorry if I have given you pain, and I hope\\r\\nthat you do not think very meanly of me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had\\r\\nlistened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long\\r\\nnarrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but it is not my custom to discuss my most\\r\\nintimate personal affairs in this public manner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you won’t forgive me? You won’t shake hands before I go?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure.” He put out his hand\\r\\nand coldly grasped that which she extended to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had hoped,” suggested Holmes, “that you would have joined us in a\\r\\nfriendly supper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that there you ask a little too much,” responded his lordship.\\r\\n“I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can\\r\\nhardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that, with your\\r\\npermission, I will now wish you all a very good-night.” He included us\\r\\nall in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I trust that you at least will honor me with your company,” said\\r\\nSherlock Holmes. “It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton,\\r\\nfor I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and\\r\\nthe blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our\\r\\nchildren from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country\\r\\nunder a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the\\r\\nStars and Stripes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\n“The case has been an interesting one,” remarked Holmes, when our\\r\\nvisitors had left us, “because it serves to show very clearly how\\r\\nsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems\\r\\nto be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than the\\r\\nsequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than\\r\\nthe result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland\\r\\nYard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘I WILL WISH YOU ALL A VERY GOOD NIGHT.’”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were not yourself at fault at all, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the\\r\\nlady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other\\r\\nthat she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.\\r\\nObviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her\\r\\nto change her mind. What could that something be? She could not have\\r\\nspoken to any one when she was out, for she had been in the company\\r\\nof the bridegroom. Had she seen some one, then? If she had, it must\\r\\nbe some one from America, because she had spent so short a time in\\r\\nthis country that she could hardly have allowed any one to acquire so\\r\\ndeep an influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her\\r\\nto change her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived,\\r\\nby a process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an\\r\\nAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he possess so\\r\\nmuch influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband.\\r\\nHer young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes and under\\r\\nstrange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St.\\r\\nSimon’s narrative. When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in\\r\\nthe bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as\\r\\nthe dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and\\r\\nof her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’\\r\\nparlance means taking possession of that which another person has a\\r\\nprior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had\\r\\ngone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous\\r\\nhusband—the chances being in favor of the latter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how in the world did you find them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in\\r\\nhis hands the value of which he did not himself know. The initials were\\r\\nof course of the highest importance, but more valuable still was it\\r\\nto know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most\\r\\nselect London hotels.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you deduce the select?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eight-pence for a\\r\\nglass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. There are\\r\\nnot many in London which charge at that rate. In the second one which\\r\\nI visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection of the\\r\\nbook that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only the\\r\\nday before, and on looking over the entries against him, I came upon\\r\\nthe very items which I had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters\\r\\nwere to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and\\r\\nbeing fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to\\r\\ngive them some paternal advice, and to point out to them that it would\\r\\nbe better in every way that they should make their position a little\\r\\nclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in particular.\\r\\nI invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the\\r\\nappointment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But with no very good result,” I remarked. “His conduct was certainly\\r\\nnot very gracious.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Watson,” said Holmes, smiling, “perhaps you would not be very\\r\\ngracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you\\r\\nfound yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. I think\\r\\nthat we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully, and thank our stars\\r\\nthat we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. Draw\\r\\nyour chair up, and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have\\r\\nstill to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure XI\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” said I, as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down\\r\\nthe street, “here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that\\r\\nhis relatives should allow him to come out alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend rose lazily from his arm-chair and stood with his hands in\\r\\nthe pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a\\r\\nbright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still\\r\\nlay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. Down\\r\\nthe centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly\\r\\nband by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of\\r\\nthe foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. The gray pavement\\r\\nhad been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so\\r\\nthat there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction\\r\\nof the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman\\r\\nwhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a\\r\\nmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was dressed\\r\\nin a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat\\r\\nbrown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-gray trousers. Yet his actions were\\r\\nin absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he\\r\\nwas running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man\\r\\ngives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran\\r\\nhe jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face\\r\\ninto the most extraordinary contortions.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth can be the matter with him?” I asked. “He is looking up\\r\\nat the numbers of the houses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe that he is coming here,” said Holmes, rubbing his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think\\r\\nthat I recognize the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?” As he spoke,\\r\\nthe man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell\\r\\nuntil the whole house resounded with the clanging.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still\\r\\ngesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his\\r\\neyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. For\\r\\na while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked\\r\\nat his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his\\r\\nreason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against\\r\\nthe wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away\\r\\nto the centre of the room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the\\r\\neasy-chair, and, sitting beside him, patted his hand, and chatted with\\r\\nhim in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?” said he. “You\\r\\nare fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have recovered\\r\\nyourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into any little\\r\\nproblem which you may submit to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against\\r\\nhis emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his\\r\\nlips tight, and turned his face towards us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt you think me mad?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see that you have had some great trouble,” responded Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“God knows I have!—a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason,\\r\\nso sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might have faced,\\r\\nalthough I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.\\r\\nPrivate affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming\\r\\ntogether, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very\\r\\nsoul. Besides, it is not I alone. The very noblest in the land may\\r\\nsuffer, unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray compose yourself, sir,” said Holmes, “and let me have a clear\\r\\naccount of who you are, and what it is that has befallen you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name,” answered our visitor, “is probably familiar to your ears.\\r\\nI am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder & Stevenson, of\\r\\nThreadneedle Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner\\r\\nin the second largest private banking concern in the City of London.\\r\\nWhat could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens\\r\\nof London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, all curiosity, until\\r\\nwith another effort he braced himself to tell his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel that time is of value,” said he; “that is why I hastened\\r\\nhere when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your\\r\\nco-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground, and hurried\\r\\nfrom there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. That\\r\\nis why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little\\r\\nexercise. I feel better now, and I will put the facts before you as\\r\\nshortly and yet as clearly as I can.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking\\r\\nbusiness as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative\\r\\ninvestments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the\\r\\nnumber of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means of laying out\\r\\nmoney is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. We\\r\\nhave done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and\\r\\nthere are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon\\r\\nthe security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card\\r\\nwas brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I saw the\\r\\nname, for it was that of none other than—well, perhaps even to you I\\r\\nhad better say no more than that it was a name which is a household\\r\\nword all over the earth—one of the highest, noblest, most exalted\\r\\nnames in England. I was overwhelmed by the honor, and attempted, when\\r\\nhe entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the\\r\\nair of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Holder,’ said he, ‘I have been informed that you are in the habit\\r\\nof advancing money.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The firm do so when the security is good,’ I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is absolutely essential to me,’ said he, ‘that I should have\\r\\n£50,000 at once. I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten\\r\\ntimes over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter of\\r\\nbusiness, and to carry out that business myself. In my position you\\r\\ncan readily understand that it is unwise to place one’s self under\\r\\nobligations.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most\\r\\ncertainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it\\r\\nright to charge. But it is very essential to me that the money should\\r\\nbe paid at once.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own\\r\\nprivate purse,’ said I, ‘were it not that the strain would be rather\\r\\nmore than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do it in the\\r\\nname of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that,\\r\\neven in your case, every business-like precaution should be taken.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I should much prefer to have it so,’ said he, raising up a square,\\r\\nblack morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. ‘You have\\r\\ndoubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Precisely.’ He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,\\r\\nflesh-colored velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewelry which he\\r\\nhad named. ‘There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,’ said he, ‘and the\\r\\nprice of the gold chasing is incalculable. The lowest estimate would\\r\\nput the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked. I am\\r\\nprepared to leave it with you as my security.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity\\r\\nfrom it to my illustrious client.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You doubt its value?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Not at all. I only doubt—’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about\\r\\nthat. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain\\r\\nthat I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter\\r\\nof form. Is the security sufficient?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ample.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof of\\r\\nthe confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I have heard\\r\\nof you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all\\r\\ngossip upon the matter, but, above all, to preserve this coronet with\\r\\nevery possible precaution, because I need not say that a great public\\r\\nscandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to\\r\\nit would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no\\r\\nberyls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to\\r\\nreplace them. I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and\\r\\nI shall call for it in person on Monday morning.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more; but,\\r\\ncalling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty £1000 notes.\\r\\nWhen I was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon\\r\\nthe table in front of me, I could not but think with some misgivings of\\r\\nthe immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. There could be no\\r\\ndoubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would\\r\\nensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having\\r\\never consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter\\r\\nthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe, and turned once\\r\\nmore to my work.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so\\r\\nprecious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers’ safes had been\\r\\nforced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how terrible\\r\\nwould be the position in which I should find myself! I determined,\\r\\ntherefore, that for the next few days I would always carry the case\\r\\nbackward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out\\r\\nof my reach. With this intention, I called a cab, and drove out to\\r\\nmy house at Streatham, carrying the jewel with me. I did not breathe\\r\\nfreely until I had taken it up-stairs and locked it in the bureau of my\\r\\ndressing-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to\\r\\nthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep out of\\r\\nthe house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three maid-servants\\r\\nwho have been with me a number of years, and whose absolute reliability\\r\\nis quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, the second waiting-maid,\\r\\nhas only been in my service a few months. She came with an excellent\\r\\ncharacter, however, and has always given me satisfaction. She is a very\\r\\npretty girl, and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung\\r\\nabout the place. That is the only drawback which we have found to her,\\r\\nbut we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it will\\r\\nnot take me long to describe it. I am a widower, and have an only son,\\r\\nArthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes—a grievous\\r\\ndisappointment. I have no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell\\r\\nme that I have spoiled him. Very likely I have. When my dear wife died\\r\\nI felt that he was all I had to love. I could not bear to see the smile\\r\\nfade even for a moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish.\\r\\nPerhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner,\\r\\nbut I meant it for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my\\r\\nbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild, wayward, and,\\r\\nto speak the truth, I could not trust him in the handling of large\\r\\nsums of money. When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic\\r\\nclub, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a\\r\\nnumber of men with long purses and expensive habits. He learned to play\\r\\nheavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again\\r\\nand again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his\\r\\nallowance, that he might settle his debts of honor. He tried more than\\r\\nonce to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but\\r\\neach time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to\\r\\ndraw him back again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell\\r\\nshould gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him\\r\\nto my house, and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the\\r\\nfascination of his manner. He is older than Arthur, a man of the world\\r\\nto his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a\\r\\nbrilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. Yet when I think\\r\\nof him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, I am\\r\\nconvinced from his cynical speech, and the look which I have caught in\\r\\nhis eyes, that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think,\\r\\nand so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman’s quick insight\\r\\ninto character.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when\\r\\nmy brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I\\r\\nadopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is\\r\\na sunbeam in my house—sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager\\r\\nand house-keeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could\\r\\nbe. She is my right hand. I do not know what I could do without her. In\\r\\nonly one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has\\r\\nasked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she\\r\\nhas refused him. I think that if any one could have drawn him into the\\r\\nright path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have\\r\\nchanged his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late—for ever too\\r\\nlate!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and I\\r\\nshall continue with my miserable story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night, after\\r\\ndinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious\\r\\ntreasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my\\r\\nclient. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am sure, left\\r\\nthe room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed. Mary and Arthur\\r\\nwere much interested, and wished to see the famous coronet, but I\\r\\nthought it better not to disturb it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where have you put it?’ asked Arthur.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘In my own bureau.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, I hope to goodness the house won’t be burgled during the\\r\\nnight,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is locked up,’ I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I have\\r\\nopened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of what\\r\\nhe said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with a very\\r\\ngrave face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Look here, dad,’ said he, with his eyes cast down, ‘can you let me\\r\\nhave £200?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, I cannot!’ I answered, sharply. ‘I have been far too generous\\r\\nwith you in money matters.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You have been very kind,’ said he: ‘but I must have this money, or\\r\\nelse I can never show my face inside the club again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And a very good thing, too!’ I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonored man,’ said he.\\r\\n‘I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money in some way, and\\r\\nif you will not let me have it, then I must try other means.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. ‘You\\r\\nshall not have a farthing from me,’ I cried; on which he bowed and left\\r\\nthe room without another word.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was\\r\\nsafe, and locked it again. Then I started to go round the house to see\\r\\nthat all was secure—a duty which I usually leave to Mary, but which I\\r\\nthought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down the stairs\\r\\nI saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and\\r\\nfastened as I approached.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tell me, dad,’ said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, ‘did\\r\\nyou give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Certainly not.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she has\\r\\nonly been to the side gate to see some one; but I think that it is\\r\\nhardly safe, and should be stopped.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You must speak to her in the morning, or I will, if you prefer it.\\r\\nAre you sure that everything is fastened?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite sure, dad.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Then, good-night.’ I kissed her, and went up to my bedroom again,\\r\\nwhere I was soon asleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am endeavoring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may have\\r\\nany bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question me upon any\\r\\npoint which I do not make clear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be\\r\\nparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my\\r\\nmind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two\\r\\nin the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in the house. It\\r\\nhad ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind\\r\\nit as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening\\r\\nwith all my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound\\r\\nof footsteps moving softly in the next room. I slipped out of bed, all\\r\\npalpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Arthur!’ I screamed, ‘you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that\\r\\ncoronet?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed\\r\\nonly in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding\\r\\nthe coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending\\r\\nit with all his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp, and\\r\\nturned as pale as death. I snatched it up and examined it. One of the\\r\\ngold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You blackguard!’ I shouted, beside myself with rage. ‘You have\\r\\ndestroyed it! You have dishonored me for ever! Where are the jewels\\r\\nwhich you have stolen?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Stolen!’ he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, you thief!’ I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I call you\\r\\na liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another\\r\\npiece?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You have called me names enough,’ said he; ‘I will not stand it any\\r\\nlonger. I shall not say another word about this business since you have\\r\\nchosen to insult me. I will leave your house in the morning and make my\\r\\nown way in the world.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You shall leave it in the hands of the police!’ I cried, half-mad\\r\\nwith grief and rage. ‘I shall have this matter probed to the bottom.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You shall learn nothing from me,’ said he, with a passion such as I\\r\\nshould not have thought was in his nature. ‘If you choose to call the\\r\\npolice, let the police find what they can.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in\\r\\nmy anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of\\r\\nthe coronet and of Arthur’s face, she read the whole story, and, with\\r\\na scream, fell down senseless on the ground. I sent the house-maid for\\r\\nthe police, and put the investigation into their hands at once. When\\r\\nthe inspector and a constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood\\r\\nsullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to\\r\\ncharge him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private\\r\\nmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was\\r\\nnational property. I was determined that the law should have its way in\\r\\neverything.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘At least,’ said he, ‘you will not have me arrested at once. It would\\r\\nbe to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for\\r\\nfive minutes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have\\r\\nstolen,’ said I. And then realizing the dreadful position in which I\\r\\nwas placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honor, but that\\r\\nof one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened\\r\\nto raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it\\r\\nall if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing\\r\\nstones.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You may as well face the matter,’ said I; ‘you have been caught in\\r\\nthe act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you\\r\\nbut make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the\\r\\nberyls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,’ he answered, turning\\r\\naway from me, with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any\\r\\nwords of mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called\\r\\nin the inspector, and gave him into custody. A search was made at once,\\r\\nnot only of his person, but of his room, and of every portion of the\\r\\nhouse where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of\\r\\nthem could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all\\r\\nour persuasions and our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell,\\r\\nand I, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried\\r\\nround to you, to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the\\r\\nmatter. The police have openly confessed that they can at present make\\r\\nnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think necessary. I\\r\\nhave already offered a reward of £1000. My God, what shall I do! I have\\r\\nlost my honor, my gems, and my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe put a hand on either side of his head, and rocked himself to and\\r\\nfro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted\\r\\nand his eyes fixed upon the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you receive much company?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“None, save my partner with his family, and an occasional friend of\\r\\nArthur’s. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one\\r\\nelse, I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you go out much in society?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is unusual in a young girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is\\r\\nfour-and-twenty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her\\r\\nalso.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Terrible! She is even more affected than I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have neither of you any doubt as to your son’s guilt?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can we have, when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in\\r\\nhis hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of the\\r\\ncoronet at all injured?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was twisted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me. But it\\r\\nis too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If his purpose\\r\\nwere innocent, why did he not say so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His\\r\\nsilence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular\\r\\npoints about the case. What did the police think of the noise which\\r\\nawoke you from your sleep?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They considered that it might be caused by Arthur’s closing his\\r\\nbedroom door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as\\r\\nto wake a household. What did they say, then, of the disappearance of\\r\\nthese gems?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the\\r\\nhope of finding them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have they thought of looking outside the house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has\\r\\nalready been minutely examined.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, my dear sir,” said Holmes, “is it not obvious to you now that\\r\\nthis matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the\\r\\npolice were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a\\r\\nsimple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is\\r\\ninvolved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his\\r\\nbed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,\\r\\ntook out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of\\r\\nit, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the\\r\\nthirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then\\r\\nreturned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed\\r\\nhimself to the greatest danger of being discovered. I ask you now, is\\r\\nsuch a theory tenable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what other is there?” cried the banker, with a gesture of despair.\\r\\n“If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is our task to find that out,” replied Holmes; “so now, if you\\r\\nplease, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, and devote\\r\\nan hour to glancing a little more closely into details.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,\\r\\nwhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were\\r\\ndeeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I confess that\\r\\nthe guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it\\r\\ndid to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’s\\r\\njudgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long\\r\\nas he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. He hardly spoke\\r\\na word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin\\r\\nupon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest\\r\\nthought. Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little\\r\\nglimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into\\r\\na desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway\\r\\njourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest residence\\r\\nof the great financier.\\r\\n\\r\\nFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back\\r\\na little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad\\r\\nlawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the\\r\\nentrance. On the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into\\r\\na narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the\\r\\nkitchen door, and forming the tradesmen’s entrance. On the left ran a\\r\\nlane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds\\r\\nat all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left\\r\\nus standing at the door, and walked slowly all round the house, across\\r\\nthe front, down the tradesmen’s path, and so round by the garden behind\\r\\ninto the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I went into\\r\\nthe dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. We were\\r\\nsitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.\\r\\nShe was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,\\r\\nwhich seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. I do\\r\\nnot think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman’s face.\\r\\nHer lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.\\r\\nAs she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater\\r\\nsense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the\\r\\nmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,\\r\\nwith immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence,\\r\\nshe went straight to her uncle, and passed her hand over his head with\\r\\na sweet womanly caress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you not,\\r\\ndad?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what women’s instincts\\r\\nare. I know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for\\r\\nhaving acted so harshly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with the\\r\\ncoronet in his hand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh do, do take my word\\r\\nfor it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say no more. It is\\r\\nso dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall never let it drop until the gems are found—never, Mary! Your\\r\\naffection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. Far\\r\\nfrom hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman down from London\\r\\nto inquire more deeply into it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman?” she asked, facing round to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in the\\r\\nstable lane now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The stable lane?” She raised her dark eyebrows. “What can he hope to\\r\\nfind there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will\\r\\nsucceed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth, that my cousin\\r\\nArthur is innocent of this crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may prove\\r\\nit,” returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his\\r\\nshoes. “I believe I have the honor of addressing Miss Mary Holder.\\r\\nMight I ask you a question or two?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You heard nothing yourself last night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, and\\r\\nI came down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you fasten all\\r\\nthe windows?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were they all fastened this morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to\\r\\nyour uncle last night that she had been out to see him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may\\r\\nhave heard uncle’s remarks about the coronet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,\\r\\nand that the two may have planned the robbery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what is the good of all these vague theories,” cried the banker,\\r\\nimpatiently, “when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet\\r\\nin his hands?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl,\\r\\nMiss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I presume?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met\\r\\nher slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes; he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His\\r\\nname is Francis Prosper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He stood,” said Holmes, “to the left of the door—that is to say,\\r\\nfarther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And he is a man with a wooden leg?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady’s expressive black\\r\\neyes. “Why, you are like a magician,” said she. “How do you know that?”\\r\\nShe smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes’s thin, eager\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be very glad now to go up-stairs,” said he. “I shall probably\\r\\nwish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps I had better\\r\\ntake a look at the lower windows before I go up.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the\\r\\nlarge one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. This he\\r\\nopened, and made a very careful examination of the sill with his\\r\\npowerful magnifying lens. “Now we shall go up-stairs,” said he, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker’s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with\\r\\na gray carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. Holmes went to the\\r\\nbureau first and looked hard at the lock.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which key was used to open it?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That which my son himself indicated—that of the cupboard of the\\r\\nlumber-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you it here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is it on the dressing-table.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a noiseless lock,” said he. “It is no wonder that it did not\\r\\nwake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must have a\\r\\nlook at it.” He opened the case, and, taking out the diadem, he laid it\\r\\nupon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller’s art,\\r\\nand the thirty-six stones were the finest that I have ever seen. At one\\r\\nside of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three\\r\\ngems had been torn away.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Mr. Holder,” said Holmes, “here is the corner which corresponds\\r\\nto that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will\\r\\nbreak it off.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker recoiled in horror. “I should not dream of trying,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I will.” Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without\\r\\nresult. “I feel it give a little,” said he; “but, though I am\\r\\nexceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to\\r\\nbreak it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do you think would\\r\\nhappen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a\\r\\npistol shot. Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards\\r\\nof your bed, and that you heard nothing of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss\\r\\nHolder?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess that I still share my uncle’s perplexity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. We have certainly been favored with extraordinary luck\\r\\nduring this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not\\r\\nsucceed in clearing the matter up. With your permission, Mr. Holder, I\\r\\nshall now continue my investigations outside.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any\\r\\nunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour\\r\\nor more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow\\r\\nand his features as inscrutable as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr. Holder,”\\r\\nsaid he; “I can serve you best by returning to my rooms.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe banker wrung his hands. “I shall never see them again!” he cried.\\r\\n“And my son? You give me hopes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My opinion is in no way altered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, for God’s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in\\r\\nmy house last night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning\\r\\nbetween nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it\\r\\nclearer. I understand that you give me _carte blanche_ to act for you,\\r\\nprovided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on\\r\\nthe sum I may draw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would give my fortune to have them back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.\\r\\nGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here again\\r\\nbefore evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was obvious to me that my companion’s mind was now made up about\\r\\nthe case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could\\r\\neven dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I\\r\\nendeavored to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to\\r\\nsome other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not\\r\\nyet three when we found ourselves in our room once more. He hurried to\\r\\nhis chamber, and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common\\r\\nloafer. With his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red\\r\\ncravat, and his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that this should do,” said he, glancing into the glass above\\r\\nthe fireplace. “I only wish that you could come with me, Watson, but\\r\\nI fear that it won’t do. I may be on the trail in this matter, or I\\r\\nmay be following a will-of-the-wisp, but I shall soon know which it\\r\\nis. I hope that I may be back in a few hours.” He cut a slice of beef\\r\\nfrom the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of\\r\\nbread, and, thrusting this rude meal into his pocket, he started off\\r\\nupon his expedition.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent\\r\\nspirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it\\r\\ndown into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I only looked in as I passed,” said he. “I am going right on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time before I\\r\\nget back. Don’t wait up for me in case I should be late.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are you getting on?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham since\\r\\nI saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a very sweet\\r\\nlittle problem, and I would not have missed it for a good deal.\\r\\nHowever, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable\\r\\nclothes off and return to my highly respectable self.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction\\r\\nthan his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even\\r\\na touch of color upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened up-stairs, and a\\r\\nfew minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that\\r\\nhe was off once more upon his congenial hunt.\\r\\n\\r\\nI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so I\\r\\nretired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for\\r\\ndays and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his\\r\\nlateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he came in,\\r\\nbut when I came down to breakfast in the morning, there he was with a\\r\\ncup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim\\r\\nas possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson,” said he; “but you\\r\\nremember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is after nine now,” I answered. “I should not be surprised if\\r\\nthat were he. I thought I heard a ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the change\\r\\nwhich had come over him, for his face, which was naturally of a broad\\r\\nand massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed\\r\\nto me at least a shade whiter. He entered with a weariness and lethargy\\r\\nwhich was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,\\r\\nand he dropped heavily into the arm-chair which I pushed forward for\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried,” said he.\\r\\n“Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in\\r\\nthe world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonored age. One sorrow\\r\\ncomes close upon the heels of another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Deserted you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,\\r\\nand a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to her last\\r\\nnight, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all\\r\\nmight have been well with him. Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say\\r\\nso. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “‘MY DEAREST UNCLE,—I feel that I have brought trouble\\r\\n  upon you, and that if I had acted differently this terrible\\r\\n  misfortune might never have occurred. I cannot, with this\\r\\n  thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and\\r\\n  I feel that I must leave you for ever. Do not worry about my\\r\\n  future, for that is provided for; and, above all, do not search\\r\\n  for me, for it will be fruitless labor and an ill-service to\\r\\n  me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving       MARY.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points\\r\\nto suicide?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible solution.\\r\\nI trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have learned\\r\\nsomething! Where are the gems?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would not think £1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would pay ten.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter. And\\r\\nthere is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book? Here is a\\r\\npen. Better make it out for £4000 pounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes walked\\r\\nover to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three\\r\\ngems in it, and threw it down upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have it!” he gasped. “I am saved! I am saved!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he\\r\\nhugged his recovered gems to his bosom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder,” said Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nrather sternly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Owe!” He caught up a pen. “Name the sum, and I will pay it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble\\r\\nlad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be\\r\\nproud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to have one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it was not Arthur who took them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once, to let him know\\r\\nthat the truth is known.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an interview\\r\\nwith him, and, finding that he would not tell me the story, I told it\\r\\nto him, on which he had to confess that I was right, and to add the\\r\\nvery few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of\\r\\nthis morning, however, may open his lips.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For Heaven’s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached it. And\\r\\nlet me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and\\r\\nfor you to hear: there has been an understanding between Sir George\\r\\nBurnwell and your niece Mary. They have now fled together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My Mary? Impossible!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is, unfortunately, more than possible; it is certain. Neither you\\r\\nnor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted\\r\\nhim into your family circle. He is one of the most dangerous men in\\r\\nEngland—a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man\\r\\nwithout heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing of such men. When\\r\\nhe breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her,\\r\\nshe flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. The devil\\r\\nknows best what he said, but at least she became his tool, and was in\\r\\nthe habit of seeing him nearly every evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot, and I will not, believe it!” cried the banker, with an ashen\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your\\r\\nniece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down\\r\\nand talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable\\r\\nlane. His footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had\\r\\nhe stood there. She told him of the coronet. His wicked lust for gold\\r\\nkindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. I have no doubt\\r\\nthat she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover\\r\\nextinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.\\r\\nShe had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming\\r\\ndown-stairs, on which she closed the window rapidly, and told you about\\r\\none of the servants’ escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was\\r\\nall perfectly true.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you, but\\r\\nhe slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.\\r\\nIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so\\r\\nhe rose, and looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking\\r\\nvery stealthily along the passage, until she disappeared into your\\r\\ndressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some\\r\\nclothes, and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this\\r\\nstrange affair. Presently she emerged from the room again, and in the\\r\\nlight of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious\\r\\ncoronet in her hands. She passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling\\r\\nwith horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,\\r\\nwhence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her\\r\\nstealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to some one in the\\r\\ngloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing\\r\\nquite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without\\r\\na horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the instant that\\r\\nshe was gone he realized how crushing a misfortune this would be for\\r\\nyou, and how all-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just\\r\\nas he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the\\r\\nsnow, and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the\\r\\nmoonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught\\r\\nhim, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one\\r\\nside of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle,\\r\\nyour son struck Sir George, and cut him over the eye. Then something\\r\\nsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his\\r\\nhands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had\\r\\njust observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle, and\\r\\nwas endeavoring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it possible?” gasped the banker.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he\\r\\nfelt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain\\r\\nthe true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved\\r\\nlittle enough consideration at his hands. He took the more chivalrous\\r\\nview, however, and preserved her secret.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,”\\r\\ncried Mr. Holder. “Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have been! And his\\r\\nasking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! The dear fellow wanted\\r\\nto see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. How\\r\\ncruelly I have misjudged him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I arrived at the house,” continued Holmes, “I at once went very\\r\\ncarefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow\\r\\nwhich might help me. I knew that none had fallen since the evening\\r\\nbefore, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve\\r\\nimpressions. I passed along the tradesmen’s path, but found it all\\r\\ntrampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at the\\r\\nfar side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,\\r\\nwhose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg.\\r\\nI could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run\\r\\nback swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel\\r\\nmarks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away.\\r\\nI thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart,\\r\\nof whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so.\\r\\nI passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random\\r\\ntracks, which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable\\r\\nlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of\\r\\nme.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double\\r\\nline which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. I was\\r\\nat once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your\\r\\nson. The first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly,\\r\\nand, as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot,\\r\\nit was obvious that he had passed after the other. I followed them up,\\r\\nand found that they led to the hall window, where Boots had worn all\\r\\nthe snow away while waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was\\r\\na hundred yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced\\r\\nround, where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,\\r\\nand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that I\\r\\nwas not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and another little\\r\\nsmudge of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came\\r\\nto the high-road at the other end, I found that the pavement had been\\r\\ncleared, so there was an end to that clew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the sill\\r\\nand framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could at once\\r\\nsee that some one had passed out. I could distinguish the outline of\\r\\nan instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then\\r\\nbeginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A man\\r\\nhad waited outside the window, some one had brought the gems; the deed\\r\\nhad been overseen by your son, he had pursued the thief, had struggled\\r\\nwith him, they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength\\r\\ncausing injuries which neither alone could have effected. He had\\r\\nreturned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his\\r\\nopponent. So far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man,\\r\\nand who was it brought him the coronet?\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,\\r\\nwhatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, I knew\\r\\nthat it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained\\r\\nyour niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son\\r\\nallow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible\\r\\nreason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent\\r\\nexplanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret\\r\\nwas a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at\\r\\nthat window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my\\r\\nconjecture became a certainty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for\\r\\nwho else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to\\r\\nyou? I knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends\\r\\nwas a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had\\r\\nheard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. It\\r\\nmust have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.\\r\\nEven though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still\\r\\nflatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word\\r\\nwithout compromising his own family.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I\\r\\nwent in the shape of a loafer to Sir George’s house, managed to pick\\r\\nup an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his\\r\\nhead the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,\\r\\nmade all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. With these I\\r\\njourneyed down to Streatham, and saw that they exactly fitted the\\r\\ntracks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “I CLAPPED A PISTOL TO HIS HEAD”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,” said Mr.\\r\\nHolder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home and\\r\\nchanged my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to play then,\\r\\nfor I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and I\\r\\nknew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the\\r\\nmatter. I went and saw him. At first, of course, he denied everything.\\r\\nBut when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to\\r\\nbluster, and took down a life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man,\\r\\nhowever, and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.\\r\\nThen he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give\\r\\nhim a price for the stones he held—£1000 apiece. That brought out the\\r\\nfirst signs of grief that he had shown. ‘Why, dash it all!’ said he,\\r\\n‘I’ve let them go at six hundred for the three!’ I soon managed to get\\r\\nthe address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there\\r\\nwould be no prosecution. Off I set to him, and after much chaffering I\\r\\ngot our stones at £1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told\\r\\nhim that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o’clock,\\r\\nafter what I may call a really hard day’s work.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A day which has saved England from a great public scandal,” said the\\r\\nbanker, rising. “Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall\\r\\nnot find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your skill has indeed\\r\\nexceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I must fly to my dear boy\\r\\nto apologize to him for the wrong which I have done him. As to what you\\r\\ntell me of poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can\\r\\ninform me where she is now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that we may safely say,” returned Holmes, “that she is\\r\\nwherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that\\r\\nwhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient\\r\\npunishment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAdventure XII\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the man who loves art for its own sake,” remarked Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\ntossing aside the advertisement sheet of _The Daily Telegraph_, “it is\\r\\nfrequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the\\r\\nkeenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe,\\r\\nWatson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little\\r\\nrecords of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I\\r\\nam bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence\\r\\nnot so much to the many _causes célèbres_ and sensational trials in\\r\\nwhich I have figured, but rather to those incidents which may have been\\r\\ntrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties\\r\\nof deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special\\r\\nprovince.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from\\r\\nthe charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have erred, perhaps,” he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with\\r\\nthe tongs, and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was\\r\\nwont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious, rather than a\\r\\nmeditative mood—“you have erred perhaps in attempting to put color and\\r\\nlife into each of your statements, instead of confining yourself to the\\r\\ntask of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect\\r\\nwhich is really the only notable feature about the thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,” I\\r\\nremarked, with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism which\\r\\nI had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend’s\\r\\nsingular character.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it is not selfishness or conceit,” said he, answering, as was his\\r\\nwont, my thoughts rather than my words. “If I claim full justice for my\\r\\nart, it is because it is an impersonal thing—a thing beyond myself.\\r\\nCrime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather\\r\\nthan upon the crime that you should dwell. You have degraded what\\r\\nshould have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast\\r\\non either side of a cheery fire in the old room at Baker Street. A\\r\\nthick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-colored houses, and the\\r\\nopposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy\\r\\nyellow wreaths. Our gas was lit, and shone on the white cloth and\\r\\nglimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously\\r\\ninto the advertisement columns of a succession of papers, until at\\r\\nlast, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very\\r\\nsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the same time,” he remarked, after a pause, during which he had sat\\r\\npuffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, “you can hardly\\r\\nbe open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you\\r\\nhave been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not\\r\\ntreat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. The small matter in which I\\r\\nendeavored to help the King of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss\\r\\nMary Sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the twisted\\r\\nlip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are\\r\\noutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I fear\\r\\nthat you may have bordered on the trivial.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The end may have been so,” I answered, “but the methods I hold to have\\r\\nbeen novel and of interest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant\\r\\npublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by\\r\\nhis left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!\\r\\nBut, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot blame you, for the days of\\r\\nthe great cases are past. Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all\\r\\nenterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to\\r\\nbe degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and\\r\\ngiving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I\\r\\nhave touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning\\r\\nmarks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!” He tossed a crumpled letter\\r\\nacross to me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and ran\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\n  “DEAR MR. HOLMES,—I am very anxious to consult you as\\r\\n  to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has\\r\\n  been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten\\r\\n  to-morrow, if I do not inconvenience you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Yours faithfully,     VIOLET HUNTER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know the young lady?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not I.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is half-past ten now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You remember\\r\\nthat the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim\\r\\nat first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this\\r\\ncase, also.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for\\r\\nhere, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. She was\\r\\nplainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a\\r\\nplover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own\\r\\nway to make in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,” said she, as my\\r\\ncompanion rose to greet her; “but I have had a very strange experience,\\r\\nand as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask\\r\\nadvice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what\\r\\nI should do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I\\r\\ncan to serve you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see that Holmes was favorably impressed by the manner and\\r\\nspeech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion,\\r\\nand then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger tips\\r\\ntogether, to listen to her story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been a governess for five years,” said she, “in the family\\r\\nof Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel received an\\r\\nappointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his children over\\r\\nto America with him, so that I found myself without a situation. I\\r\\nadvertised, and I answered advertisements, but without success. At last\\r\\nthe little money which I had saved began to run short, and I was at my\\r\\nwits’ end as to what I should do.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End called\\r\\nWestaway’s, and there I used to call about once a week in order to\\r\\nsee whether anything had turned up which might suit me. Westaway was\\r\\nthe name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by\\r\\nMiss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are\\r\\nseeking employment wait in an ante-room, and are then shown in one by\\r\\none, when she consults her ledgers, and sees whether she has anything\\r\\nwhich would suit them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office as\\r\\nusual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout\\r\\nman with a very smiling face, and a great heavy chin which rolled down\\r\\nin fold upon fold over his throat, sat at her elbow with a pair of\\r\\nglasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.\\r\\nAs I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair, and turned quickly to\\r\\nMiss Stoper:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘That will do,’ said he; ‘I could not ask for anything better. Capital!\\r\\ncapital!’ He seemed quite enthusiastic, and rubbed his hands together\\r\\nin the most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking man that\\r\\nit was quite a pleasure to look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘As governess?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, sir.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And what salary do you ask?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I had £4 a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, tut, tut! sweating—rank sweating!’ he cried, throwing his fat\\r\\nhands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. ‘How\\r\\ncould any one offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions\\r\\nand accomplishments?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,’ said I. ‘A\\r\\nlittle French, a little German, music, and drawing—’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tut, tut!’ he cried. ‘This is all quite beside the question. The\\r\\npoint is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a\\r\\nlady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are not fitted\\r\\nfor the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part\\r\\nin the history of the country. But if you have, why, then, how could\\r\\nany gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three\\r\\nfigures? Your salary with me, madam, would commence at £100 a year.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an\\r\\noffer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman, however, seeing\\r\\nperhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and\\r\\ntook out a note.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is also my custom,’ said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion\\r\\nuntil his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white\\r\\ncreases of his face, ‘to advance to my young ladies half their salary\\r\\nbeforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey\\r\\nand their wardrobe.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful\\r\\na man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a\\r\\ngreat convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the\\r\\nwhole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I\\r\\nquite committed myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘May I ask where you live, sir?’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles on the\\r\\nfar side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my dear young\\r\\nlady, and the dearest old country-house.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would be.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘One child—one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could\\r\\nsee him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three\\r\\ngone before you could wink!’ He leaned back in his chair and laughed\\r\\nhis eyes into his head again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was a little startled at the nature of the child’s amusement, but\\r\\nthe father’s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My sole duties, then,’ I asked, ‘are to take charge of a single child?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,’ he cried.\\r\\n‘Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to\\r\\nobey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they\\r\\nwere such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. You see no\\r\\ndifficulty, heh?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I should be happy to make myself useful.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you\\r\\nknow—faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress which\\r\\nwe might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No,’ said I, considerably astonished at his words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, no.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my\\r\\nhair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.\\r\\nIt has been considered artistic. I could not dream of sacrificing it in\\r\\nthis off-hand fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am afraid that that is quite impossible,’ said I. He had been\\r\\nwatching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a shadow\\r\\npass over his face as I spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am afraid that it is quite essential,’ said he. ‘It is a little\\r\\nfancy of my wife’s, and ladies’ fancies, you know, madam, ladies’\\r\\nfancies must be consulted. And so you won’t cut your hair?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, sir, I really could not,’ I answered, firmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a pity,\\r\\nbecause in other respects you would really have done very nicely. In\\r\\nthat case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more of your young\\r\\nladies.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a\\r\\nword to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance\\r\\nupon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a\\r\\nhandsome commission through my refusal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?’ she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘If you please, Miss Stoper.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most\\r\\nexcellent offers in this fashion,’ said she, sharply. ‘You can hardly\\r\\nexpect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.\\r\\nGood-day to you, Miss Hunter.’ She struck a gong upon the table, and I\\r\\nwas shown out by the page.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found little\\r\\nenough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, I began\\r\\nto ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After all,\\r\\nif these people had strange fads, and expected obedience on the most\\r\\nextraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their\\r\\neccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting £100 a\\r\\nyear. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by\\r\\nwearing it short, and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I\\r\\nwas inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after\\r\\nI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride, so far as to go back\\r\\nto the agency and inquire whether the place was still open, when I\\r\\nreceived this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it here, and I\\r\\nwill read it to you:\\r\\n\\r\\n    “‘The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.\\r\\n\\r\\n    “‘DEAR MISS HUNTER,—Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your\\r\\n    address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have\\r\\n    reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you\\r\\n    should come, for she has been much attracted by my description\\r\\n    of you. We are willing to give £30 a quarter, or £120 a year, so\\r\\n    as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads\\r\\n    may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My wife\\r\\n    is fond of a particular shade of electric blue, and would like\\r\\n    you to wear such a dress in-doors in the morning. You need not,\\r\\n    however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one\\r\\n    belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which\\r\\n    would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting\\r\\n    here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that\\r\\n    need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is\\r\\n    no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its\\r\\n    beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must\\r\\n    remain firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased\\r\\n    salary may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as\\r\\n    the child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and\\r\\n    I shall meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know\\r\\n    your train.         Yours faithfully,      JEPHRO RUCASTLE.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and my mind\\r\\nis made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before\\r\\ntaking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your\\r\\nconsideration.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the\\r\\nquestion,” said Holmes, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you would not advise me to refuse?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a\\r\\nsister of mine apply for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself formed\\r\\nsome opinion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle\\r\\nseemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not possible that his\\r\\nwife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear\\r\\nshe should be taken to an asylum, and that he humors her fancies in\\r\\nevery way in order to prevent an outbreak.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is a possible solution—in fact, as matters stand, it is the most\\r\\nprobable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household\\r\\nfor a young lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, yes, of course the pay is good—too good. That is what makes\\r\\nme uneasy. Why should they give you £120 a year, when they could have\\r\\ntheir pick for £40? There must be some strong reason behind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand\\r\\nafterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I\\r\\nfelt that you were at the back of me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that your\\r\\nlittle problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my\\r\\nway for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some of\\r\\nthe features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger—”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Danger! What danger do you foresee?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head gravely. “It would cease to be a danger if we\\r\\ncould define it,” said he. “But at any time, day or night, a telegram\\r\\nwould bring me down to your help.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is enough.” She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety\\r\\nall swept from her face. “I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in\\r\\nmy mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor\\r\\nhair to-night, and start for Winchester to-morrow.” With a few grateful\\r\\nwords to Holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At least,” said I, as we heard her quick, firm step descending the\\r\\nstairs, “she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take\\r\\ncare of herself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And she would need to be,” said Holmes, gravely; “I am much mistaken\\r\\nif we do not hear from her before many days are past.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long before my friend’s prediction was fulfilled. A\\r\\nfortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts turning\\r\\nin her direction, and wondering what strange side-alley of human\\r\\nexperience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual salary,\\r\\nthe curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something\\r\\nabnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were\\r\\na philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to\\r\\ndetermine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an\\r\\nhour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the\\r\\nmatter away with a wave of his hand when I mentioned it. “Data! data!\\r\\ndata!” he cried, impatiently. “I can’t make bricks without clay.” And\\r\\nyet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should\\r\\never have accepted such a situation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night, just as\\r\\nI was thinking of turning in, and Holmes was settling down to one of\\r\\nthose all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in,\\r\\nwhen I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night,\\r\\nand find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in\\r\\nthe morning. He opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the\\r\\nmessage, threw it across to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,” said he, and turned back to his\\r\\nchemical studies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe summons was a brief and urgent one.\\r\\n\\r\\n  “Please be at the ‘Black Swan’ Hotel at Winchester at\\r\\n  mid-day to-morrow,” it said. “Do come! I am at my wits’\\r\\n  end.                                       HUNTER.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will you come with me?” asked Holmes, glancing up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should wish to.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just look it up, then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is a train at half-past nine,” said I, glancing over my\\r\\nBradshaw. “It is due at Winchester at 11.30.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my\\r\\nanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\r\\n\\r\\nBy eleven o’clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old\\r\\nEnglish capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the\\r\\nway down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them\\r\\ndown, and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a\\r\\nlight blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across\\r\\nfrom west to east. The sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was\\r\\nan exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man’s energy.\\r\\nAll over the country-side, away to the rolling hills around Aldershot,\\r\\nthe little red and gray roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from\\r\\namid the light green of the new foliage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are they not fresh and beautiful?” I cried, with all the enthusiasm of\\r\\na man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Holmes shook his head gravely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know, Watson,” said he, “that it is one of the curses of a mind\\r\\nwith a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to\\r\\nmy own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are\\r\\nimpressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which\\r\\ncomes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with\\r\\nwhich crime may be committed there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “Who would associate crime with these dear old\\r\\nhomesteads?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief, Watson,\\r\\nfounded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London\\r\\ndo not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and\\r\\nbeautiful country-side.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You horrify me!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion can\\r\\ndo in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no lane so\\r\\nvile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard’s\\r\\nblow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbors, and\\r\\nthen the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of\\r\\ncomplaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime\\r\\nand the dock. But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,\\r\\nfilled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of\\r\\nthe law. Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness\\r\\nwhich may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.\\r\\nHad this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I\\r\\nshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of country\\r\\nwhich makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is not personally\\r\\nthreatened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. She has her freedom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What _can_ be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover\\r\\nthe facts as far as we know them. But which of these is correct can\\r\\nonly be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt\\r\\nfind waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we\\r\\nshall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “Black Swan” is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no\\r\\ndistance from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting\\r\\nfor us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon\\r\\nthe table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am so delighted that you have come,” she said, earnestly. “It is so\\r\\nvery kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I should do. Your\\r\\nadvice will be altogether invaluable to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray tell us what has happened to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr. Rucastle to\\r\\nbe back before three. I got his leave to come into town this morning,\\r\\nthough he little knew for what purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us have everything in its due order.” Holmes thrust his long thin\\r\\nlegs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole, with no\\r\\nactual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is only fair to\\r\\nthem to say that. But I cannot understand them, and I am not easy in my\\r\\nmind about them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can you not understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just as\\r\\nit occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here, and drove me\\r\\nin his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he said, beautifully\\r\\nsituated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square\\r\\nblock of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp\\r\\nand bad weather. There are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and\\r\\non the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high-road,\\r\\nwhich curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. This\\r\\nground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part\\r\\nof Lord Southerton’s preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately\\r\\nin front of the hall door has given its name to the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Illustration: “‘I AM SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU HAVE COME’”]\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was\\r\\nintroduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. There was no\\r\\ntruth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable\\r\\nin your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is not mad. I found her\\r\\nto be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not\\r\\nmore than thirty, I should think, while he can hardly be less than\\r\\nforty-five. From their conversation I have gathered that they have been\\r\\nmarried about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only\\r\\nchild by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia.\\r\\nMr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them\\r\\nwas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her step-mother. As the\\r\\ndaughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite imagine that\\r\\nher position must have been uncomfortable with her father’s young wife.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colorless in mind as well as in\\r\\nfeature. She impressed me neither favorably nor the reverse. She was a\\r\\nnonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both\\r\\nto her husband and to her little son. Her light gray eyes wandered\\r\\ncontinually from one to the other, noting every little want and\\r\\nforestalling it if possible. He was kind to her also in his bluff,\\r\\nboisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.\\r\\nAnd yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. She would often be lost\\r\\nin deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. More than once I\\r\\nhave surprised her in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the\\r\\ndisposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never\\r\\nmet so utterly spoilt and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small\\r\\nfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large. His\\r\\nwhole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of\\r\\npassion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving pain to any creature\\r\\nweaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he\\r\\nshows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little\\r\\nbirds, and insects. But I would rather not talk about the creature, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad of all details,” remarked my friend, “whether they seem to\\r\\nyou to be relevant or not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one unpleasant\\r\\nthing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance\\r\\nand conduct of the servants. There are only two, a man and his wife.\\r\\nToller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled\\r\\nhair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. Twice since I have\\r\\nbeen with them he has been quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to\\r\\ntake no notice of it. His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a\\r\\nsour face, as silent as Mrs. Rucastle, and much less amiable. They are\\r\\na most unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in\\r\\nthe nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner\\r\\nof the building.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very\\r\\nquiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after breakfast and\\r\\nwhispered something to her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh yes,’ said he, turning to me; ‘we are very much obliged to you,\\r\\nMiss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.\\r\\nI assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your\\r\\nappearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become\\r\\nyou. You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you\\r\\nwould be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of\\r\\nblue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore\\r\\nunmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not have been\\r\\na better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle\\r\\nexpressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated\\r\\nin its vehemence. They were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which\\r\\nis a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,\\r\\nwith three long windows reaching down to the floor. A chair had been\\r\\nplaced close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. In\\r\\nthis I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on\\r\\nthe other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest\\r\\nstories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how comical he\\r\\nwas, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs. Rucastle, however, who\\r\\nhas evidently no sense of humor, never so much as smiled, but sat with\\r\\nher hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. After an\\r\\nhour or so, Mr. Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence\\r\\nthe duties of the day, and that I might change my dress and go to\\r\\nlittle Edward in the nursery.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly\\r\\nsimilar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I sat in the\\r\\nwindow, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which\\r\\nmy employer had an immense _répertoire_, and which he told inimitably.\\r\\nThen he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and, moving my chair a little\\r\\nsideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me\\r\\nto read aloud to him. I read for about ten minutes, beginning in the\\r\\nheart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he\\r\\nordered me to cease and to change my dress.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to what\\r\\nthe meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. They\\r\\nwere always very careful, I observed, to turn my face away from the\\r\\nwindow, so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going\\r\\non behind my back. At first it seemed to be impossible, but I soon\\r\\ndevised a means. My hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought\\r\\nseized me, and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. On\\r\\nthe next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, I put my handkerchief\\r\\nup to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that\\r\\nthere was behind me. I confess that I was disappointed. There was\\r\\nnothing. At least that was my first impression. At the second glance,\\r\\nhowever, I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton\\r\\nRoad, a small bearded man in a gray suit, who seemed to be looking in\\r\\nmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are usually\\r\\npeople there. This man, however, was leaning against the railings\\r\\nwhich bordered our field, and was looking earnestly up. I lowered my\\r\\nhandkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle, to find her eyes fixed upon\\r\\nme with a most searching gaze. She said nothing, but I am convinced\\r\\nthat she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand, and had seen what\\r\\nwas behind me. She rose at once.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Jephro,’ said she, ‘there is an impertinent fellow upon the road\\r\\nthere who stares up at Miss Hunter.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?’ he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No; I know no one in these parts.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to him to\\r\\ngo away.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Surely it would be better to take no notice.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn round\\r\\nand wave him away like that.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew down\\r\\nthe blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have not sat again\\r\\nin the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the\\r\\nroad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray continue,” said Holmes. “Your narrative promises to be a most\\r\\ninteresting one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may prove to\\r\\nbe little relation between the different incidents of which I speak.\\r\\nOn the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches, Mr. Rucastle\\r\\ntook me to a small out-house which stands near the kitchen door. As we\\r\\napproached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as\\r\\nof a large animal moving about.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Look in here!’ said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two\\r\\nplanks. ‘Is he not a beauty?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I looked through, and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a\\r\\nvague figure huddled up in the darkness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Don’t be frightened,’ said my employer, laughing at the start which I\\r\\nhad given. ‘It’s only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine, but really\\r\\nold Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. We\\r\\nfeed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as\\r\\nkeen as mustard. Toller lets him loose every night, and God help the\\r\\ntrespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. For goodness’ sake don’t you\\r\\never on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it\\r\\nis as much as your life is worth.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to look\\r\\nout of my bedroom window about two o’clock in the morning. It was a\\r\\nbeautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was\\r\\nsilvered over and almost as bright as day. I was standing, rapt in\\r\\nthe peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was aware that something was\\r\\nmoving under the shadow of the copper beeches. As it emerged into the\\r\\nmoonshine I saw what it was. It was a giant dog, as large as a calf,\\r\\ntawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting\\r\\nbones. It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow\\r\\nupon the other side. That dreadful silent sentinel sent a chill to my\\r\\nheart which I do not think that any burglar could have done.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you\\r\\nknow, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil\\r\\nat the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed,\\r\\nI began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by\\r\\nrearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers\\r\\nin the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked.\\r\\nI had filled the first two with my linen, and, as I had still much\\r\\nto pack away, I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the\\r\\nthird drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere\\r\\noversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The\\r\\nvery first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There\\r\\nwas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what\\r\\nit was. It was my coil of hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and\\r\\nthe same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded\\r\\nitself upon me. How _could_ my hair have been locked in the drawer?\\r\\nWith trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and\\r\\ndrew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and\\r\\nI assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle\\r\\nas I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned\\r\\nthe strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the\\r\\nRucastles, as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a\\r\\ndrawer which they had locked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I\\r\\nsoon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was\\r\\none wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door\\r\\nwhich faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened\\r\\ninto this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I\\r\\nascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door,\\r\\nhis keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very\\r\\ndifferent person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His\\r\\ncheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins\\r\\nstood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried\\r\\npast me without a word or a look.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This aroused my curiosity; so when I went out for a walk in the\\r\\ngrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could\\r\\nsee the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a\\r\\nrow, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered\\r\\nup. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down,\\r\\nglancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as\\r\\nmerry and jovial as ever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Ah!’ said he, ‘you must not think me rude if I passed you without a\\r\\nword, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I assured him that I was not offended. ‘By-the-way,’ said I, ‘you\\r\\nseem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has\\r\\nthe shutters up.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He looked surprised, and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my\\r\\nremark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Photography is one of my hobbies,’ said he. ‘I have made my dark room\\r\\nup there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.\\r\\nWho would have believed it? Who would have ever believed it?’ He spoke\\r\\nin a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at\\r\\nme. I read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there was\\r\\nsomething about that suite of rooms which I was not to know, I was all\\r\\non fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have my\\r\\nshare of that. It was more a feeling of duty—a feeling that some good\\r\\nmight come from my penetrating to this place. They talk of woman’s\\r\\ninstinct; perhaps it was woman’s instinct which gave me that feeling.\\r\\nAt any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout for any\\r\\nchance to pass the forbidden door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,\\r\\nbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to do in\\r\\nthese deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large black linen\\r\\nbag with him through the door. Recently he has been drinking hard, and\\r\\nyesterday evening he was very drunk; and, when I came up-stairs, there\\r\\nwas the key in the door. I have no doubt at all that he had left it\\r\\nthere. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both down-stairs, and the child was\\r\\nwith them, so that I had an admirable opportunity. I turned the key\\r\\ngently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,\\r\\nwhich turned at a right angle at the farther end. Round this corner\\r\\nwere three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.\\r\\nThey each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows\\r\\nin the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening\\r\\nlight glimmered dimly through them. The centre door was closed, and\\r\\nacross the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of\\r\\nan iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened\\r\\nat the other with stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and\\r\\nthe key was not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with\\r\\nthe shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from\\r\\nbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was a\\r\\nskylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the passage\\r\\ngazing at the sinister door, and wondering what secret it might veil,\\r\\nI suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room, and saw a shadow\\r\\npass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which\\r\\nshone out from under the door. A mad, unreasoning terror rose up in\\r\\nme at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly,\\r\\nand I turned and ran—ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me\\r\\nclutching at the skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through\\r\\nthe door, and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘So,’ said he, smiling, ‘it was you, then. I thought that it must be\\r\\nwhen I saw the door open.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Oh, I am so frightened!’ I panted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My dear young lady! my dear young lady!’—you cannot think how\\r\\ncaressing and soothing his manner was—‘and what has frightened you, my\\r\\ndear young lady?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I was\\r\\nkeenly on my guard against him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered. ‘But it\\r\\nis so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran\\r\\nout again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Only that?’ said he, looking at me keenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, what did you think?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Why do you think that I lock this door?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am sure that I do not know.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you see?’ He\\r\\nwas still smiling in the most amiable manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I am sure if I had known—’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over that\\r\\nthreshold again—’ here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of\\r\\nrage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon—‘I’ll throw\\r\\nyou to the mastiff.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that I\\r\\nmust have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing until I\\r\\nfound myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I thought of you,\\r\\nMr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without some advice. I was\\r\\nfrightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,\\r\\neven of the child. They were all horrible to me. If I could only bring\\r\\nyou down all would be well. Of course I might have fled from the house,\\r\\nbut my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon\\r\\nmade up. I would send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down\\r\\nto the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then\\r\\nreturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my mind\\r\\nas I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I remembered\\r\\nthat Toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that\\r\\nevening, and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had\\r\\nany influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him\\r\\nfree. I slipped in in safety, and lay awake half the night in my joy at\\r\\nthe thought of seeing you. I had no difficulty in getting leave to come\\r\\ninto Winchester this morning, but I must be back before three o’clock,\\r\\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all\\r\\nthe evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you\\r\\nall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you could\\r\\ntell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should do.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. My\\r\\nfriend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his\\r\\npockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Toller still drunk?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do nothing\\r\\nwith him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the wine-cellar.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave\\r\\nand sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could perform one\\r\\nmore feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite\\r\\nexceptional woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will try. What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o’clock, my friend and I.\\r\\nThe Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will, we hope, be\\r\\nincapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might give the alarm. If\\r\\nyou could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the\\r\\nkey upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will do it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of course\\r\\nthere is only one feasible explanation. You have been brought there to\\r\\npersonate some one, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.\\r\\nThat is obvious. As to who this prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is\\r\\nthe daughter, Miss Alice Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said\\r\\nto have gone to America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her\\r\\nin height, figure, and the color of your hair. Hers had been cut off,\\r\\nvery possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of\\r\\ncourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you came\\r\\nupon her tresses. The man in the road was, undoubtedly, some friend of\\r\\nhers—possibly her _fiancé_—and no doubt, as you wore the girl’s dress\\r\\nand were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever\\r\\nhe saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that Miss Rucastle was\\r\\nperfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. The dog\\r\\nis let loose at night to prevent him from endeavoring to communicate\\r\\nwith her. So much is fairly clear. The most serious point in the case\\r\\nis the disposition of the child.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth has that to do with it?” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as\\r\\nto the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. Don’t you see\\r\\nthat the converse is equally valid. I have frequently gained my first\\r\\nreal insight into the character of parents by studying their children.\\r\\nThis child’s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty’s\\r\\nsake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as I should\\r\\nsuspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in\\r\\ntheir power.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes,” cried our client. “A\\r\\nthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have\\r\\nhit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor\\r\\ncreature.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. We\\r\\ncan do nothing until seven o’clock. At that hour we shall be with you,\\r\\nand it will not be long before we solve the mystery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the\\r\\nCopper Beeches, having put up our trap at a way-side public-house. The\\r\\ngroup of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in\\r\\nthe light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even\\r\\nhad Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you managed it?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA loud thudding noise came from somewhere down-stairs. “That is\\r\\nMrs. Toller in the cellar,” said she. “Her husband lies snoring on\\r\\nthe kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates of Mr.\\r\\nRucastle’s.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have done well indeed!” cried Holmes, with enthusiasm. “Now lead\\r\\nthe way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,\\r\\nand found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had\\r\\ndescribed. Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. Then he\\r\\ntried the various keys in the lock, but without success. No sound came\\r\\nfrom within, and at the silence Holmes’s face clouded over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust that we are not too late,” said he. “I think, Miss Hunter,\\r\\nthat we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put your shoulder to\\r\\nit, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was an old rickety door, and gave at once before our united\\r\\nstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There was no\\r\\nfurniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of\\r\\nlinen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There has been some villainy here,” said Holmes; “this beauty has\\r\\nguessed Miss Hunter’s intentions, and has carried his victim off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it.” He swung\\r\\nhimself up onto the roof. “Ah, yes,” he cried; “here’s the end of a\\r\\nlong light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But it is impossible,” said Miss Hunter; “the ladder was not there\\r\\nwhen the Rucastles went away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and\\r\\ndangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were he\\r\\nwhose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it would be\\r\\nas well for you to have your pistol ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the\\r\\ndoor of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his\\r\\nhand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of\\r\\nhim, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You villain!” said he, “where’s your daughter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is for me to ask you that,” he shrieked, “you thieves! Spies and\\r\\nthieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I’ll serve\\r\\nyou!” He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’s gone for the dog!” cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have my revolver,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Better close the front door,” cried Holmes, and we all rushed down\\r\\nthe stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the\\r\\nbaying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying\\r\\nsound which it was dreadful to listen to. An elderly man with a red\\r\\nface and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My God!” he cried. “Some one has loosed the dog. It’s not been fed for\\r\\ntwo days. Quick, quick, or it’ll be too late!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with Toller\\r\\nhurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle\\r\\nburied in Rucastle’s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the\\r\\nground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and it fell over with its\\r\\nkeen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. With\\r\\nmuch labor we separated them, and carried him, living but horribly\\r\\nmangled, into the house. We laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and,\\r\\nhaving despatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife, I\\r\\ndid what I could to relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him\\r\\nwhen the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Toller!” cried Miss Hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went\\r\\nup to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn’t let me know what you were\\r\\nplanning, for I would have told you that your pains were wasted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” said Holmes, looking keenly at her. “It is clear that Mrs. Toller\\r\\nknows more about this matter than any one else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it, for there are several points\\r\\non which I must confess that I am still in the dark.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will soon make it clear to you,” said she; “and I’d have done\\r\\nso before now if I could ha’ got out from the cellar. If there’s\\r\\npolice-court business over this, you’ll remember that I was the one\\r\\nthat stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice’s friend too.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn’t, from the time that\\r\\nher father married again. She was slighted like, and had no say in\\r\\nanything; but it never really became bad for her until after she met\\r\\nMr. Fowler at a friend’s house. As well as I could learn, Miss Alice\\r\\nhad rights of her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she\\r\\nwas, that she never said a word about them, but just left everything in\\r\\nMr. Rucastle’s hands. He knew he was safe with her; but when there was\\r\\na chance of a husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the\\r\\nlaw would give him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on\\r\\nit. He wanted her to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not,\\r\\nhe could use her money. When she wouldn’t do it, he kept on worrying\\r\\nher until she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death’s door.\\r\\nThen she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her\\r\\nbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn’t make no change in her young\\r\\nman, and he stuck to her as true as man could be.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said Holmes, “I think that what you have been good enough to\\r\\ntell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce all\\r\\nthat remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this system of\\r\\nimprisonment?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the\\r\\ndisagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was it, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should\\r\\nbe, blockaded the house, and, having met you, succeeded by certain\\r\\narguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests\\r\\nwere the same as his.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman,” said Mrs.\\r\\nToller, serenely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of\\r\\ndrink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master\\r\\nhad gone out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have it, sir, just as it happened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller,” said Holmes, “for you\\r\\nhave certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And here comes\\r\\nthe country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think, Watson, that we had\\r\\nbest escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester, as it seems to me that our\\r\\n_locus standi_ now is rather a questionable one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper\\r\\nbeeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but was always a\\r\\nbroken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.\\r\\nThey still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of\\r\\nRucastle’s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them.\\r\\nMr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married, by special license, in\\r\\nSouthampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a\\r\\nGovernment appointment in the Island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet\\r\\nHunter, my friend Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no\\r\\nfurther interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of\\r\\none of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\\r\\nWalsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBY W.

D. BLACKMORE’S NOVELS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHis descriptions are wonderfully vivid and natural. His pages are\\r\\nbrightened everywhere with great humor; the quaint, dry turns of\\r\\nthought remind you occasionally of Fielding.—_London Times._\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Blackmore always writes like a scholar and a\\r\\ngentleman—_Athenæum_, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis tales, all of them, are pre-eminently meritorious. They are\\r\\nremarkable for their careful elaboration, the conscientious finish of\\r\\ntheir workmanship, their affluence of striking dramatic and narrative\\r\\nincident, their close observation and general interpretation of nature,\\r\\ntheir profusion of picturesque description, and their quiet and\\r\\nsustained humor. Besides, they are pervaded by a bright and elastic\\r\\natmosphere which diffuses a cheery feeling of healthful and robust\\r\\nvigor. While they charm us by their sprightly vivacity and their\\r\\nnaturalness, they never in the slightest degree transcend the limits\\r\\nof delicacy or good taste. While radiating warmth and brightness, they\\r\\nare as pure as the new-fallen snow.... Their literary execution is\\r\\nadmirable, and their dramatic power is as exceptional as their moral\\r\\npurity.—_Christian Intelligencer_, N. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\n  LORNA DOONE.

He occupies a position in American literature entirely\\r\\nhis own.... His is the literature of honest sentiment, pure and\\r\\ntender.—_N. Y. Press._\\r\\n\\r\\nA romance by Captain King is always a pleasure, because he has so\\r\\ncomplete a mastery of the subjects with which he deals.... Captain\\r\\nKing has few rivals in his domain.... The general tone of Captain\\r\\nKing’s stories is highly commendable. The heroes are simple, frank,\\r\\nand soldierly; the heroines are dignified and maidenly in the most\\r\\nunconventional situations.—_Epoch_, N. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll Captain King’s stories are full of spirit and with the true ring\\r\\nabout them.—_Philadelphia Item._\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain King’s stories of army life are so brilliant and intense, they\\r\\nhave such a ring of true experience, and his characters are so lifelike\\r\\nand vivid that the announcement of a new one is always received with\\r\\npleasure.—_New Haven Palladium._\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain King is a delightful story-teller.—_Washington Post._\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the delineation of war scenes Captain King’s style is crisp and\\r\\nvigorous, inspiring in the breast of the reader a thrill of genuine\\r\\npatriotic fervor.—_Boston Commonwealth._\\r\\n\\r\\nCaptain King is almost without a rival in the field he has chosen....\\r\\nHis style is at once vigorous and sentimental in the best sense of that\\r\\nword, so that his novels are pleasing to young men as well as young\\r\\nwomen.—_Pittsburgh Bulletin._\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is good to think that there is at least one man who believes that\\r\\nall the spirit of romance and chivalry has not yet died out of the\\r\\nworld, and that there are as brave and honest hearts to-day as there\\r\\nwere in the days of knights and paladins.—_Philadelphia Record._\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLISHED BY HARPER & BROTHERS, NEW YORK.\\r\\n\\r\\n—> _Any of the above works sent by mail, postage prepaid, to any part\\r\\nof the United States, Canada, or Mexico, on receipt of the price._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE CHRIST.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  By LEW.

(_In a\\r\\n    Gladstone Box._)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnything so startling, new, and distinctive as the leading feature of\\r\\nthis romance does not often appear in works of fiction.... Some of Mr.\\r\\nWallace’s writing is remarkable for its pathetic eloquence. The scenes\\r\\ndescribed in the New Testament are rewritten with the power and skill\\r\\nof an accomplished master of style.—_N. Y. Times._\\r\\n\\r\\nIts real basis is a description of the life of the Jews and Romans\\r\\nat the beginning of the Christian era, and this is both forcible and\\r\\nbrilliant.... We are carried through a surprising variety of scenes;\\r\\nwe witness a sea-fight, a chariot-race, the internal economy of a\\r\\nRoman galley, domestic interiors at Antioch, at Jerusalem, and among\\r\\nthe tribes of the desert; palaces, prisons, the haunts of dissipated\\r\\nRoman youth, the houses of pious families of Israel. There is plenty of\\r\\nexciting incident; everything is animated, vivid and glowing.—_N. Y.\\r\\nTribune._\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the opening of the volume to the very close the reader’s interest\\r\\nwill be kept at the highest pitch, and the novel will be pronounced by\\r\\nall one of the greatest novels of the day.—_Boston Post._\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ben Hur” is interesting, and its characterization is fine and strong.\\r\\nMeanwhile it evinces careful study of the period in which the scene\\r\\nis laid, and will help those who read it with reasonable attention to\\r\\nrealize the nature and conditions of Hebrew life in Jerusalem and Roman\\r\\nlife at Antioch at the time of our Saviour’s advent.—_Examiner_, N. Y.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe book is one of unquestionable power, and will be read with unwonted\\r\\ninterest by many readers who are weary of the conventional novel and\\r\\nromance.—_Boston Journal._\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most remarkable and delightful books. It is as real and\\r\\nwarm as life itself, and as attractive as the grandest and most heroic\\r\\nchapters of history.—_Indianapolis Journal._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPUBLISHED BY HARPER & BROTHERS, NEW YORK.\\r\\n\\r\\n—> _The above work will be sent by mail, postage prepaid, to any part\\r\\nof the United States, Canada, or Mexico, on receipt of the price._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTranscriber’s Note:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe text published in the original publication has been\\r\\npreserved except as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n  Punctuation has been standardised.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 5\\r\\n  scored by six almost paralled _changed to_\\r\\n  scored by six almost parallel\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 20\\r\\n  Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description _changed to_\\r\\n  Sherlock Holmes’s succinct description\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 37\\r\\n  injustice to hestitate _changed to_\\r\\n  injustice to hesitate\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 46\\r\\n  I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped _changed to_\\r\\n  I saw him that afternoon so enrapt\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 81\\r\\n  his had the natural ef-effect _changed to_\\r\\n  his had the natural effect\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 87\\r\\n  brother and siser; but of course _changed to_\\r\\n  brother and sister; but of course\\r\\n\\r\\n  Page 93\\r\\n  at this.

The\\r\\npublic has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out\\r\\nin the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that\\r\\noccasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly\\r\\nstrong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only\\r\\nnow, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those\\r\\nmissing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The\\r\\ncrime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to\\r\\nme compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest\\r\\nshock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now,\\r\\nafter this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and\\r\\nfeeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity\\r\\nwhich utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public, which has\\r\\nshown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given\\r\\nthem of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man, that they\\r\\nare not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I\\r\\nshould have considered it my first duty to do so, had I not been barred\\r\\nby a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn\\r\\nupon the third of last month.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had\\r\\ninterested me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never\\r\\nfailed to read with care the various problems which came before the\\r\\npublic. And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private\\r\\nsatisfaction, to employ his methods in their solution, though with\\r\\nindifferent success. There was none, however, which appealed to me like\\r\\nthis tragedy of Ronald Adair. As I read the evidence at the inquest,\\r\\nwhich led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or\\r\\npersons unknown, I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss\\r\\nwhich the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes. There\\r\\nwere points about this strange business which would, I was sure, have\\r\\nspecially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have been\\r\\nsupplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation\\r\\nand the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe. All day, as\\r\\nI drove upon my round, I turned over the case in my mind and found no\\r\\nexplanation which appeared to me to be adequate. At the risk of telling\\r\\na twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to\\r\\nthe public at the conclusion of the inquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth,\\r\\nat that time governor of one of the Australian colonies. Adair’s mother\\r\\nhad returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract, and\\r\\nshe, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together at\\r\\n427 Park Lane. The youth moved in the best society--had, so far as was\\r\\nknown, no enemies and no particular vices. He had been engaged to Miss\\r\\nEdith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement had been broken off by\\r\\nmutual consent some months before, and there was no sign that it had\\r\\nleft any very profound feeling behind it. For the rest {sic} the man’s\\r\\nlife moved in a narrow and conventional circle, for his habits were\\r\\nquiet and his nature unemotional. Yet it was upon this easy-going young\\r\\naristocrat that death came, in most strange and unexpected form, between\\r\\nthe hours of ten and eleven-twenty on the night of March 30, 1894.\\r\\n\\r\\nRonald Adair was fond of cards--playing continually, but never for such\\r\\nstakes as would hurt him. He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish,\\r\\nand the Bagatelle card clubs. It was shown that, after dinner on the day\\r\\nof his death, he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club. He had\\r\\nalso played there in the afternoon. The evidence of those who had played\\r\\nwith him--Mr. Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran--showed that\\r\\nthe game was whist, and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.\\r\\nAdair might have lost five pounds, but not more. His fortune was a\\r\\nconsiderable one, and such a loss could not in any way affect him. He\\r\\nhad played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious\\r\\nplayer, and usually rose a winner. It came out in evidence that, in\\r\\npartnership with Colonel Moran, he had actually won as much as four\\r\\nhundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some weeks before, from Godfrey\\r\\nMilner and Lord Balmoral. So much for his recent history as it came out\\r\\nat the inquest.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at ten.\\r\\nHis mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation. The\\r\\nservant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second\\r\\nfloor, generally used as his sitting-room. She had lit a fire there, and\\r\\nas it smoked she had opened the window. No sound was heard from the room\\r\\nuntil eleven-twenty, the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her\\r\\ndaughter. Desiring to say good-night, she attempted to enter her son’s\\r\\nroom. The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to\\r\\ntheir cries and knocking. Help was obtained, and the door forced. The\\r\\nunfortunate young man was found lying near the table. His head had been\\r\\nhorribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but no weapon of any\\r\\nsort was to be found in the room. On the table lay two banknotes for\\r\\nten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold, the money\\r\\narranged in little piles of varying amount. There were some figures also\\r\\nupon a sheet of paper, with the names of some club friends opposite\\r\\nto them, from which it was conjectured that before his death he was\\r\\nendeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case\\r\\nmore complex. In the first place, no reason could be given why the\\r\\nyoung man should have fastened the door upon the inside. There was the\\r\\npossibility that the murderer had done this, and had afterwards escaped\\r\\nby the window. The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of\\r\\ncrocuses in full bloom lay beneath. Neither the flowers nor the earth\\r\\nshowed any sign of having been disturbed, nor were there any marks\\r\\nupon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road.\\r\\nApparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the\\r\\ndoor. But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to\\r\\nthe window without leaving traces. Suppose a man had fired through the\\r\\nwindow, he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a\\r\\nrevolver inflict so deadly a wound. Again, Park Lane is a frequented\\r\\nthoroughfare; there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house.\\r\\nNo one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man and there the\\r\\nrevolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will,\\r\\nand so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death.\\r\\nSuch were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery, which were further\\r\\ncomplicated by entire absence of motive, since, as I have said, young\\r\\nAdair was not known to have any enemy, and no attempt had been made to\\r\\nremove the money or valuables in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon\\r\\nsome theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line\\r\\nof least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the\\r\\nstarting-point of every investigation. I confess that I made little\\r\\nprogress. In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself\\r\\nabout six o’clock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane. A group of\\r\\nloafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window,\\r\\ndirected me to the house which I had come to see. A tall, thin man with\\r\\ncoloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being a plain-clothes\\r\\ndetective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while the others\\r\\ncrowded round to listen to what he said. I got as near him as I could,\\r\\nbut his observations seemed to me to be absurd, so I withdrew again in\\r\\nsome disgust. As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed man,\\r\\nwho had been behind me, and I knocked down several books which he was\\r\\ncarrying. I remember that as I picked them up, I observed the title\\r\\nof one of them, THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP, and it struck me that the\\r\\nfellow must be some poor bibliophile, who, either as a trade or as a\\r\\nhobby, was a collector of obscure volumes. I endeavoured to apologize\\r\\nfor the accident, but it was evident that these books which I had so\\r\\nunfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their\\r\\nowner. With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel, and I saw his\\r\\ncurved back and white side-whiskers disappear among the throng.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy observations of No. 427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem\\r\\nin which I was interested. The house was separated from the street by\\r\\na low wall and railing, the whole not more than five feet high. It was\\r\\nperfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but\\r\\nthe window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no waterpipe or\\r\\nanything which could help the most active man to climb it. More puzzled\\r\\nthan ever, I retraced my steps to Kensington. I had not been in my study\\r\\nfive minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to\\r\\nsee me. To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book\\r\\ncollector, his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white\\r\\nhair, and his precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under\\r\\nhis right arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re surprised to see me, sir,” said he, in a strange, croaking\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\r\\nI acknowledged that I was.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ve a conscience, sir, and when I chanced to see you go into\\r\\nthis house, as I came hobbling after you, I thought to myself, I’ll just\\r\\nstep in and see that kind gentleman, and tell him that if I was a bit\\r\\ngruff in my manner there was not any harm meant, and that I am much\\r\\nobliged to him for picking up my books.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You make too much of a trifle,” said I. “May I ask how you knew who I\\r\\nwas?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir, if it isn’t too great a liberty, I am a neighbour of yours,\\r\\nfor you’ll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street,\\r\\nand very happy to see you, I am sure. Maybe you collect yourself, sir.\\r\\nHere’s BRITISH BIRDS, and CATULLUS, and THE HOLY WAR--a bargain, every\\r\\none of them. With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that\\r\\nsecond shelf. It looks untidy, does it not, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me. When I turned again,\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table. I rose\\r\\nto my feet, stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement, and then\\r\\nit appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time\\r\\nin my life. Certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes, and when it\\r\\ncleared I found my collar-ends undone and the tingling after-taste of\\r\\nbrandy upon my lips. Holmes was bending over my chair, his flask in his\\r\\nhand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Watson,” said the well-remembered voice, “I owe you a thousand\\r\\napologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gripped him by the arms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes!” I cried. “Is it really you? Can it indeed be that you are\\r\\nalive? Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful\\r\\nabyss?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a moment,” said he. “Are you sure that you are really fit to\\r\\ndiscuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily\\r\\ndramatic reappearance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am all right, but indeed, Holmes, I can hardly believe my eyes. Good\\r\\nheavens! to think that you--you of all men--should be standing in my\\r\\nstudy.” Again I gripped him by the sleeve, and felt the thin, sinewy arm\\r\\nbeneath it. “Well, you’re not a spirit anyhow,” said I. “My dear chap,\\r\\nI’m overjoyed to see you. Sit down, and tell me how you came alive out\\r\\nof that dreadful chasm.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sat opposite to me, and lit a cigarette in his old, nonchalant\\r\\nmanner. He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant, but\\r\\nthe rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books\\r\\nupon the table. Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old, but\\r\\nthere was a dead-white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his\\r\\nlife recently had not been a healthy one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am glad to stretch myself, Watson,” said he. “It is no joke when a\\r\\ntall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end.\\r\\nNow, my dear fellow, in the matter of these explanations, we have, if I\\r\\nmay ask for your cooperation, a hard and dangerous night’s work in front\\r\\nof us. Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole\\r\\nsituation when that work is finished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am full of curiosity. I should much prefer to hear now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll come with me to-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you like and where you like.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is, indeed, like the old days. We shall have time for a mouthful\\r\\nof dinner before we need go. Well, then, about that chasm. I had no\\r\\nserious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that\\r\\nI never was in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You never were in it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Watson, I never was in it. My note to you was absolutely genuine.\\r\\nI had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I\\r\\nperceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty\\r\\nstanding upon the narrow pathway which led to safety. I read an\\r\\ninexorable purpose in his gray eyes. I exchanged some remarks with him,\\r\\ntherefore, and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note\\r\\nwhich you afterwards received. I left it with my cigarette-box and my\\r\\nstick, and I walked along the pathway, Moriarty still at my heels. When\\r\\nI reached the end I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but he rushed at me\\r\\nand threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and\\r\\nwas only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon\\r\\nthe brink of the fall. I have some knowledge, however, of baritsu, or\\r\\nthe Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very\\r\\nuseful to me. I slipped through his grip, and he with a horrible scream\\r\\nkicked madly for a few seconds, and clawed the air with both his hands.\\r\\nBut for all his efforts he could not get his balance, and over he went.\\r\\nWith my face over the brink, I saw him fall for a long way. Then he\\r\\nstruck a rock, bounded off, and splashed into the water.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI listened with amazement to this explanation, which Holmes delivered\\r\\nbetween the puffs of his cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the tracks!” I cried. “I saw, with my own eyes, that two went down\\r\\nthe path and none returned.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It came about in this way. The instant that the Professor had\\r\\ndisappeared, it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance\\r\\nFate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who\\r\\nhad sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for\\r\\nvengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader.\\r\\nThey were all most dangerous men. One or other would certainly get me.\\r\\nOn the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they\\r\\nwould take liberties, these men, they would soon lay themselves open,\\r\\nand sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me\\r\\nto announce that I was still in the land of the living. So rapidly does\\r\\nthe brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor\\r\\nMoriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me. In your picturesque\\r\\naccount of the matter, which I read with great interest some months\\r\\nlater, you assert that the wall was sheer. That was not literally\\r\\ntrue. A few small footholds presented themselves, and there was some\\r\\nindication of a ledge. The cliff is so high that to climb it all was\\r\\nan obvious impossibility, and it was equally impossible to make my way\\r\\nalong the wet path without leaving some tracks. I might, it is true,\\r\\nhave reversed my boots, as I have done on similar occasions, but the\\r\\nsight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have\\r\\nsuggested a deception. On the whole, then, it was best that I should\\r\\nrisk the climb. It was not a pleasant business, Watson. The fall roared\\r\\nbeneath me. I am not a fanciful person, but I give you my word that\\r\\nI seemed to hear Moriarty’s voice screaming at me out of the abyss. A\\r\\nmistake would have been fatal. More than once, as tufts of grass came\\r\\nout in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock, I\\r\\nthought that I was gone. But I struggled upward, and at last I reached a\\r\\nledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss, where I could\\r\\nlie unseen, in the most perfect comfort. There I was stretched, when\\r\\nyou, my dear Watson, and all your following were investigating in the\\r\\nmost sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At last, when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous\\r\\nconclusions, you departed for the hotel, and I was left alone. I\\r\\nhad imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures, but a very\\r\\nunexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store\\r\\nfor me. A huge rock, falling from above, boomed past me, struck the\\r\\npath, and bounded over into the chasm. For an instant I thought that\\r\\nit was an accident, but a moment later, looking up, I saw a man’s head\\r\\nagainst the darkening sky, and another stone struck the very ledge upon\\r\\nwhich I was stretched, within a foot of my head. Of course, the meaning\\r\\nof this was obvious. Moriarty had not been alone. A confederate--and\\r\\neven that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate\\r\\nwas--had kept guard while the Professor had attacked me. From a\\r\\ndistance, unseen by me, he had been a witness of his friend’s death and\\r\\nof my escape. He had waited, and then making his way round to the top of\\r\\nthe cliff, he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did not take long to think about it, Watson. Again I saw that grim\\r\\nface look over the cliff, and I knew that it was the precursor of\\r\\nanother stone. I scrambled down on to the path. I don’t think I could\\r\\nhave done it in cold blood. It was a hundred times more difficult than\\r\\ngetting up. But I had no time to think of the danger, for another stone\\r\\nsang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge. Halfway\\r\\ndown I slipped, but, by the blessing of God, I landed, torn and\\r\\nbleeding, upon the path. I took to my heels, did ten miles over the\\r\\nmountains in the darkness, and a week later I found myself in Florence,\\r\\nwith the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had only one confidant--my brother Mycroft. I owe you many apologies,\\r\\nmy dear Watson, but it was all-important that it should be thought I\\r\\nwas dead, and it is quite certain that you would not have written so\\r\\nconvincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought\\r\\nthat it was true. Several times during the last three years I have taken\\r\\nup my pen to write to you, but always I feared lest your affectionate\\r\\nregard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray\\r\\nmy secret. For that reason I turned away from you this evening when\\r\\nyou upset my books, for I was in danger at the time, and any show of\\r\\nsurprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my\\r\\nidentity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results. As to\\r\\nMycroft, I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which\\r\\nI needed. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had\\r\\nhoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous\\r\\nmembers, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I travelled for\\r\\ntwo years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa,\\r\\nand spending some days with the head lama. You may have read of the\\r\\nremarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure\\r\\nthat it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your\\r\\nfriend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a\\r\\nshort but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum the results of\\r\\nwhich I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France, I\\r\\nspent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I\\r\\nconducted in a laboratory at Montpellier, in the south of France. Having\\r\\nconcluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my\\r\\nenemies was now left in London, I was about to return when my movements\\r\\nwere hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery,\\r\\nwhich not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to\\r\\noffer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to\\r\\nLondon, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into\\r\\nviolent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my\\r\\npapers exactly as they had always been. So it was, my dear Watson, that\\r\\nat two o’clock to-day I found myself in my old armchair in my own old\\r\\nroom, and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in\\r\\nthe other chair which he has so often adorned.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April\\r\\nevening--a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had\\r\\nit not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall, spare figure and\\r\\nthe keen, eager face, which I had never thought to see again. In some\\r\\nmanner he had learned of my own sad bereavement, and his sympathy was\\r\\nshown in his manner rather than in his words. “Work is the best antidote\\r\\nto sorrow, my dear Watson,” said he; “and I have a piece of work for us\\r\\nboth to-night which, if we can bring it to a successful conclusion, will\\r\\nin itself justify a man’s life on this planet.” In vain I begged him\\r\\nto tell me more. “You will hear and see enough before morning,” he\\r\\nanswered. “We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice\\r\\nuntil half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the\\r\\nempty house.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated\\r\\nbeside him in a hansom, my revolver in my pocket, and the thrill of\\r\\nadventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent. As the\\r\\ngleam of the street-lamps flashed upon his austere features, I saw that\\r\\nhis brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed. I\\r\\nknew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle\\r\\nof criminal London, but I was well assured, from the bearing of this\\r\\nmaster huntsman, that the adventure was a most grave one--while the\\r\\nsardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded\\r\\nlittle good for the object of our quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street, but Holmes stopped\\r\\nthe cab at the corner of Cavendish Square. I observed that as he stepped\\r\\nout he gave a most searching glance to right and left, and at every\\r\\nsubsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was\\r\\nnot followed. Our route was certainly a singular one. Holmes’s knowledge\\r\\nof the byways of London was extraordinary, and on this occasion he\\r\\npassed rapidly and with an assured step through a network of mews and\\r\\nstables, the very existence of which I had never known. We emerged at\\r\\nlast into a small road, lined with old, gloomy houses, which led us into\\r\\nManchester Street, and so to Blandford Street. Here he turned swiftly\\r\\ndown a narrow passage, passed through a wooden gate into a deserted\\r\\nyard, and then opened with a key the back door of a house. We entered\\r\\ntogether, and he closed it behind us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was pitch dark, but it was evident to me that it was an empty\\r\\nhouse. Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking, and my\\r\\noutstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in\\r\\nribbons. Holmes’s cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me\\r\\nforward down a long hall, until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the\\r\\ndoor. Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves\\r\\nin a large, square, empty room, heavily shadowed in the corners, but\\r\\nfaintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond. There\\r\\nwas no lamp near, and the window was thick with dust, so that we could\\r\\nonly just discern each other’s figures within. My companion put his hand\\r\\nupon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you know where we are?” he whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely that is Baker Street,” I answered, staring through the dim\\r\\nwindow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own old\\r\\nquarters.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why are we here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might\\r\\nI trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window,\\r\\ntaking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at our\\r\\nold rooms--the starting-point of so many of your little fairy-tales? We\\r\\nwill see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power\\r\\nto surprise you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes\\r\\nfell upon it, I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down,\\r\\nand a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a man who\\r\\nwas seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the\\r\\nluminous screen of the window. There was no mistaking the poise of the\\r\\nhead, the squareness of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features.\\r\\nThe face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of\\r\\nthose black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a\\r\\nperfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out my\\r\\nhand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. He was\\r\\nquivering with silent laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens!” I cried. “It is marvellous.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety,”\\r\\n said he, and I recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the\\r\\nartist takes in his own creation. “It really is rather like me, is it\\r\\nnot?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be prepared to swear that it was you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier, of\\r\\nGrenoble, who spent some days in doing the moulding. It is a bust in\\r\\nwax. The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this\\r\\nafternoon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because, my dear Watson, I had the strongest possible reason for\\r\\nwishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really\\r\\nelsewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you thought the rooms were watched?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I KNEW that they were watched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By my old enemies, Watson. By the charming society whose leader lies\\r\\nin the Reichenbach Fall. You must remember that they knew, and only\\r\\nthey knew, that I was still alive. Sooner or later they believed that I\\r\\nshould come back to my rooms. They watched them continuously, and this\\r\\nmorning they saw me arrive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my window. He\\r\\nis a harmless enough fellow, Parker by name, a garroter by trade, and a\\r\\nremarkable performer upon the jew’s-harp. I cared nothing for him. But\\r\\nI cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind\\r\\nhim, the bosom friend of Moriarty, the man who dropped the rocks over\\r\\nthe cliff, the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London. That is\\r\\nthe man who is after me to-night Watson, and that is the man who is\\r\\nquite unaware that we are after him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend’s plans were gradually revealing themselves. From this\\r\\nconvenient retreat, the watchers were being watched and the trackers\\r\\ntracked. That angular shadow up yonder was the bait, and we were the\\r\\nhunters. In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the\\r\\nhurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us. Holmes was\\r\\nsilent and motionless; but I could tell that he was keenly alert, and\\r\\nthat his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers-by. It was\\r\\na bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the\\r\\nlong street. Many people were moving to and fro, most of them muffled in\\r\\ntheir coats and cravats. Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen\\r\\nthe same figure before, and I especially noticed two men who appeared\\r\\nto be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house\\r\\nsome distance up the street. I tried to draw my companion’s attention to\\r\\nthem; but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience, and continued\\r\\nto stare into the street. More than once he fidgeted with his feet and\\r\\ntapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall. It was evident to me\\r\\nthat he was becoming uneasy, and that his plans were not working out\\r\\naltogether as he had hoped. At last, as midnight approached and\\r\\nthe street gradually cleared, he paced up and down the room in\\r\\nuncontrollable agitation. I was about to make some remark to him, when\\r\\nI raised my eyes to the lighted window, and again experienced almost as\\r\\ngreat a surprise as before. I clutched Holmes’s arm, and pointed upward.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The shadow has moved!” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed no longer the profile, but the back, which was turned\\r\\ntowards us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or\\r\\nhis impatience with a less active intelligence than his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course it has moved,” said he. “Am I such a farcical bungler,\\r\\nWatson, that I should erect an obvious dummy, and expect that some of\\r\\nthe sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it? We have been in\\r\\nthis room two hours, and Mrs. Hudson has made some change in that figure\\r\\neight times, or once in every quarter of an hour. She works it from the\\r\\nfront, so that her shadow may never be seen. Ah!” He drew in his breath\\r\\nwith a shrill, excited intake. In the dim light I saw his head thrown\\r\\nforward, his whole attitude rigid with attention. Outside the street\\r\\nwas absolutely deserted. Those two men might still be crouching in the\\r\\ndoorway, but I could no longer see them. All was still and dark, save\\r\\nonly that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure\\r\\noutlined upon its centre. Again in the utter silence I heard that thin,\\r\\nsibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement. An instant\\r\\nlater he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I\\r\\nfelt his warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were\\r\\nquivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark\\r\\nstreet still stretched lonely and motionless before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already\\r\\ndistinguished. A low, stealthy sound came to my ears, not from the\\r\\ndirection of Baker Street, but from the back of the very house in which\\r\\nwe lay concealed. A door opened and shut. An instant later steps\\r\\ncrept down the passage--steps which were meant to be silent, but which\\r\\nreverberated harshly through the empty house. Holmes crouched back\\r\\nagainst the wall, and I did the same, my hand closing upon the handle\\r\\nof my revolver. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a\\r\\nman, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for\\r\\nan instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the\\r\\nroom. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and I had\\r\\nbraced myself to meet his spring, before I realized that he had no idea\\r\\nof our presence. He passed close beside us, stole over to the window,\\r\\nand very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot. As he sank to\\r\\nthe level of this opening, the light of the street, no longer dimmed by\\r\\nthe dusty glass, fell full upon his face. The man seemed to be beside\\r\\nhimself with excitement. His two eyes shone like stars, and his\\r\\nfeatures were working convulsively. He was an elderly man, with a thin,\\r\\nprojecting nose, a high, bald forehead, and a huge grizzled moustache.\\r\\nAn opera hat was pushed to the back of his head, and an evening dress\\r\\nshirt-front gleamed out through his open overcoat. His face was gaunt\\r\\nand swarthy, scored with deep, savage lines. In his hand he carried what\\r\\nappeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave\\r\\na metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky\\r\\nobject, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud,\\r\\nsharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. Still\\r\\nkneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and\\r\\nstrength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long,\\r\\nwhirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He\\r\\nstraightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was\\r\\na sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the\\r\\nbreech, put something in, and snapped the breech-lock. Then, crouching\\r\\ndown, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window,\\r\\nand I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as\\r\\nit peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as\\r\\nhe cuddled the butt into his shoulder; and saw that amazing target,\\r\\nthe black man on the yellow ground, standing clear at the end of his\\r\\nforesight. For an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger\\r\\ntightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud whiz and a long,\\r\\nsilvery tinkle of broken glass. At that instant Holmes sprang like a\\r\\ntiger on to the marksman’s back, and hurled him flat upon his face. He\\r\\nwas up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength he seized\\r\\nHolmes by the throat, but I struck him on the head with the butt of my\\r\\nrevolver, and he dropped again upon the floor. I fell upon him, and as\\r\\nI held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the\\r\\nclatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform,\\r\\nwith one plain-clothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and\\r\\ninto the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That you, Lestrade?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes. I took the job myself. It’s good to see you back in\\r\\nLondon, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think you want a little unofficial help. Three undetected murders in\\r\\none year won’t do, Lestrade. But you handled the Molesey Mystery with\\r\\nless than your usual--that’s to say, you handled it fairly well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had all risen to our feet, our prisoner breathing hard, with a\\r\\nstalwart constable on each side of him. Already a few loiterers had\\r\\nbegun to collect in the street. Holmes stepped up to the window, closed\\r\\nit, and dropped the blinds. Lestrade had produced two candles, and the\\r\\npolicemen had uncovered their lanterns. I was able at last to have a\\r\\ngood look at our prisoner.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned\\r\\ntowards us. With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a\\r\\nsensualist below, the man must have started with great capacities for\\r\\ngood or for evil. But one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes, with\\r\\ntheir drooping, cynical lids, or upon the fierce, aggressive nose and\\r\\nthe threatening, deep-lined brow, without reading Nature’s plainest\\r\\ndanger-signals. He took no heed of any of us, but his eyes were fixed\\r\\nupon Holmes’s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were\\r\\nequally blended. “You fiend!” he kept on muttering. “You clever, clever\\r\\nfiend!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, Colonel!” said Holmes, arranging his rumpled collar. “‘Journeys end\\r\\nin lovers’ meetings,’ as the old play says. I don’t think I have had the\\r\\npleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as I\\r\\nlay on the ledge above the Reichenbach Fall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance. “You\\r\\ncunning, cunning fiend!” was all that he could say.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not introduced you yet,” said Holmes. “This, gentlemen, is\\r\\nColonel Sebastian Moran, once of Her Majesty’s Indian Army, and the best\\r\\nheavy-game shot that our Eastern Empire has ever produced. I believe\\r\\nI am correct Colonel, in saying that your bag of tigers still remains\\r\\nunrivalled?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion. With\\r\\nhis savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger\\r\\nhimself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a SHIKARI,”\\r\\n said Holmes. “It must be very familiar to you. Have you not tethered a\\r\\nyoung kid under a tree, lain above it with your rifle, and waited for\\r\\nthe bait to bring up your tiger? This empty house is my tree, and you\\r\\nare my tiger. You have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there\\r\\nshould be several tigers, or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim\\r\\nfailing you. These,” he pointed around, “are my other guns. The parallel\\r\\nis exact.”\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage, but the constables\\r\\ndragged him back. The fury upon his face was terrible to look at.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess that you had one small surprise for me,” said Holmes. “I did\\r\\nnot anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and\\r\\nthis convenient front window. I had imagined you as operating from the\\r\\nstreet, where my friend, Lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you.\\r\\nWith that exception, all has gone as I expected.”\\r\\n\\r\\nColonel Moran turned to the official detective.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,” said he, “but at\\r\\nleast there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this\\r\\nperson. If I am in the hands of the law, let things be done in a legal\\r\\nway.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s reasonable enough,” said Lestrade. “Nothing further you\\r\\nhave to say, Mr. Holmes, before we go?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had picked up the powerful air-gun from the floor, and was\\r\\nexamining its mechanism.\\r\\n\\r\\n“An admirable and unique weapon,” said he, “noiseless and of tremendous\\r\\npower: I knew Von Herder, the blind German mechanic, who constructed it\\r\\nto the order of the late Professor Moriarty. For years I have been\\r\\naware of its existence though I have never before had the opportunity of\\r\\nhandling it. I commend it very specially to your attention, Lestrade and\\r\\nalso the bullets which fit it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can trust us to look after that, Mr. Holmes,” said Lestrade, as the\\r\\nwhole party moved towards the door. “Anything further to say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only to ask what charge you intend to prefer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What charge, sir? Why, of course, the attempted murder of Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose to appear in the matter at all. To\\r\\nyou, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which\\r\\nyou have effected. Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! With your usual\\r\\nhappy mixture of cunning and audacity, you have got him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Got him! Got whom, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man that the whole force has been seeking in vain--Colonel\\r\\nSebastian Moran, who shot the Honourable Ronald Adair with an expanding\\r\\nbullet from an air-gun through the open window of the second-floor\\r\\nfront of No. 427 Park Lane, upon the thirtieth of last month. That’s the\\r\\ncharge, Lestrade. And now, Watson, if you can endure the draught from\\r\\na broken window, I think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may\\r\\nafford you some profitable amusement.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of\\r\\nMycroft Holmes and the immediate care of Mrs. Hudson. As I entered I\\r\\nsaw, it is true, an unwonted tidiness, but the old landmarks were all\\r\\nin their place. There were the chemical corner and the acid-stained,\\r\\ndeal-topped table. There upon a shelf was the row of formidable\\r\\nscrap-books and books of reference which many of our fellow-citizens\\r\\nwould have been so glad to burn. The diagrams, the violin-case, and the\\r\\npipe-rack--even the Persian slipper which contained the tobacco--all\\r\\nmet my eyes as I glanced round me. There were two occupants of the\\r\\nroom--one, Mrs. Hudson, who beamed upon us both as we entered--the\\r\\nother, the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the\\r\\nevening’s adventures. It was a wax-coloured model of my friend, so\\r\\nadmirably done that it was a perfect facsimile. It stood on a small\\r\\npedestal table with an old dressing-gown of Holmes’s so draped round it\\r\\nthat the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope you observed all precautions, Mrs. Hudson?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I went to it on my knees, sir, just as you told me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent. You carried the thing out very well. Did you observe where\\r\\nthe bullet went?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I’m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust, for it passed\\r\\nright through the head and flattened itself on the wall. I picked it up\\r\\nfrom the carpet. Here it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes held it out to me. “A soft revolver bullet, as you perceive,\\r\\nWatson. There’s genius in that, for who would expect to find such a\\r\\nthing fired from an airgun? All right, Mrs. Hudson. I am much obliged\\r\\nfor your assistance. And now, Watson, let me see you in your old seat\\r\\nonce more, for there are several points which I should like to discuss\\r\\nwith you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had thrown off the seedy frockcoat, and now he was the Holmes of old\\r\\nin the mouse-coloured dressing-gown which he took from his effigy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The old SHIKARI’S nerves have not lost their steadiness, nor his eyes\\r\\ntheir keenness,” said he, with a laugh, as he inspected the shattered\\r\\nforehead of his bust.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the\\r\\nbrain. He was the best shot in India, and I expect that there are few\\r\\nbetter in London. Have you heard the name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, such is fame! But, then, if I remember right, you had not\\r\\nheard the name of Professor James Moriarty, who had one of the great\\r\\nbrains of the century. Just give me down my index of biographies from\\r\\nthe shelf.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe turned over the pages lazily, leaning back in his chair and blowing\\r\\ngreat clouds from his cigar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My collection of M’s is a fine one,” said he. “Moriarty himself is\\r\\nenough to make any letter illustrious, and here is Morgan the poisoner,\\r\\nand Merridew of abominable memory, and Mathews, who knocked out my left\\r\\ncanine in the waiting-room at Charing Cross, and, finally, here is our\\r\\nfriend of to-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe handed over the book, and I read:\\r\\n\\r\\nMORAN, SEBASTIAN, COLONEL. Unemployed. Formerly 1st Bangalore Pioneers.\\r\\nBorn London, 1840. Son of Sir Augustus Moran, C. B., once British\\r\\nMinister to Persia. Educated Eton and Oxford. Served in Jowaki Campaign,\\r\\nAfghan Campaign, Charasiab (despatches), Sherpur, and Cabul. Author of\\r\\nHEAVY GAME OF THE WESTERN HIMALAYAS (1881); THREE MONTHS IN THE\\r\\nJUNGLE (1884). Address: Conduit Street. Clubs: The Anglo-Indian, the\\r\\nTankerville, the Bagatelle Card Club.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the margin was written, in Holmes’s precise hand:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second most dangerous man in London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is astonishing,” said I, as I handed back the volume. “The man’s\\r\\ncareer is that of an honourable soldier.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true,” Holmes answered. “Up to a certain point he did well. He\\r\\nwas always a man of iron nerve, and the story is still told in India how\\r\\nhe crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger. There are some\\r\\ntrees, Watson, which grow to a certain height, and then suddenly develop\\r\\nsome unsightly eccentricity. You will see it often in humans. I have\\r\\na theory that the individual represents in his development the whole\\r\\nprocession of his ancestors, and that such a sudden turn to good or\\r\\nevil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his\\r\\npedigree. The person becomes, as it were, the epitome of the history of\\r\\nhis own family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is surely rather fanciful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t insist upon it. Whatever the cause, Colonel Moran began\\r\\nto go wrong. Without any open scandal, he still made India too\\r\\nhot to hold him. He retired, came to London, and again acquired an evil\\r\\nname. It was at this time that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty,\\r\\nto whom for a time he was chief of the staff. Moriarty supplied him\\r\\nliberally with money, and used him only in one or two very high-class\\r\\njobs, which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken. You may have\\r\\nsome recollection of the death of Mrs. Stewart, of Lauder, in 1887.\\r\\nNot? Well, I am sure Moran was at the bottom of it, but nothing could\\r\\nbe proved. So cleverly was the colonel concealed that, even when the\\r\\nMoriarty gang was broken up, we could not incriminate him. You remember\\r\\nat that date, when I called upon you in your rooms, how I put up the\\r\\nshutters for fear of air-guns? No doubt you thought me fanciful. I knew\\r\\nexactly what I was doing, for I knew of the existence of this remarkable\\r\\ngun, and I knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be\\r\\nbehind it. When we were in Switzerland he followed us with Moriarty,\\r\\nand it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the\\r\\nReichenbach ledge.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may think that I read the papers with some attention during my\\r\\nsojourn in France, on the look-out for any chance of laying him by the\\r\\nheels. So long as he was free in London, my life would really not have\\r\\nbeen worth living. Night and day the shadow would have been over me, and\\r\\nsooner or later his chance must have come. What could I do? I could not\\r\\nshoot him at sight, or I should myself be in the dock. There was no use\\r\\nappealing to a magistrate. They cannot interfere on the strength of what\\r\\nwould appear to them to be a wild suspicion. So I could do nothing. But\\r\\nI watched the criminal news, knowing that sooner or later I should get\\r\\nhim. Then came the death of this Ronald Adair. My chance had come at\\r\\nlast. Knowing what I did, was it not certain that Colonel Moran had done\\r\\nit? He had played cards with the lad, he had followed him home from the\\r\\nclub, he had shot him through the open window. There was not a doubt of\\r\\nit. The bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose. I came\\r\\nover at once. I was seen by the sentinel, who would, I knew, direct\\r\\nthe colonel’s attention to my presence. He could not fail to connect\\r\\nmy sudden return with his crime, and to be terribly alarmed. I was sure\\r\\nthat he would make an attempt to get me out of the way AT once, and\\r\\nwould bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose. I left him an\\r\\nexcellent mark in the window, and, having warned the police that they\\r\\nmight be needed--by the way, Watson, you spotted their presence in that\\r\\ndoorway with unerring accuracy--I took up what seemed to me to be a\\r\\njudicious post for observation, never dreaming that he would choose the\\r\\nsame spot for his attack. Now, my dear Watson, does anything remain for\\r\\nme to explain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said I. “You have not made it clear what was Colonel Moran’s\\r\\nmotive in murdering the Honourable Ronald Adair?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! my dear Watson, there we come into those realms of conjecture,\\r\\nwhere the most logical mind may be at fault. Each may form his own\\r\\nhypothesis upon the present evidence, and yours is as likely to be\\r\\ncorrect as mine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have formed one, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that it is not difficult to explain the facts. It came out in\\r\\nevidence that Colonel Moran and young Adair had, between them, won a\\r\\nconsiderable amount of money. Now, Moran undoubtedly played foul--of that\\r\\nI have long been aware. I believe that on the day of the murder Adair had\\r\\ndiscovered that Moran was cheating. Very likely he had spoken to him\\r\\nprivately, and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily\\r\\nresigned his membership of the club, and promised not to play cards\\r\\nagain. It is unlikely that a youngster like Adair would at once make a\\r\\nhideous scandal by exposing a well known man so much older than himself.\\r\\nProbably he acted as I suggest. The exclusion from his clubs would mean\\r\\nruin to Moran, who lived by his ill-gotten card-gains. He therefore\\r\\nmurdered Adair, who at the time was endeavouring to work out how\\r\\nmuch money he should himself return, since he could not profit by his\\r\\npartner’s foul play. He locked the door lest the ladies should surprise\\r\\nhim and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and\\r\\ncoins. Will it pass?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be verified or disproved at the trial. Meanwhile, come what\\r\\nmay, Colonel Moran will trouble us no more. The famous air-gun of Von\\r\\nHerder will embellish the Scotland Yard Museum, and once again\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes is free to devote his life to examining those\\r\\ninteresting little problems which the complex life of London so\\r\\nplentifully presents.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE NORWOOD BUILDER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the point of view of the criminal expert,” said Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, “London has become a singularly uninteresting city since the\\r\\ndeath of the late lamented Professor Moriarty.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree\\r\\nwith you,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, I must not be selfish,” said he, with a smile, as he pushed\\r\\nback his chair from the breakfast-table. “The community is certainly\\r\\nthe gainer, and no one the loser, save the poor out-of-work specialist,\\r\\nwhose occupation has gone. With that man in the field, one’s morning\\r\\npaper presented infinite possibilities. Often it was only the smallest\\r\\ntrace, Watson, the faintest indication, and yet it was enough to tell me\\r\\nthat the great malignant brain was there, as the gentlest tremors of\\r\\nthe edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the\\r\\ncentre. Petty thefts, wanton assaults, purposeless outrage--to the man\\r\\nwho held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole. To the\\r\\nscientific student of the higher criminal world, no capital in Europe\\r\\noffered the advantages which London then possessed. But now----” He\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things\\r\\nwhich he had himself done so much to produce.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time of which I speak, Holmes had been back for some months,\\r\\nand I at his request had sold my practice and returned to share the old\\r\\nquarters in Baker Street. A young doctor, named Verner, had purchased my\\r\\nsmall Kensington practice, and given with astonishingly little demur the\\r\\nhighest price that I ventured to ask--an incident which only explained\\r\\nitself some years later, when I found that Verner was a distant relation\\r\\nof Holmes, and that it was my friend who had really found the money.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated,\\r\\nfor I find, on looking over my notes, that this period includes the case\\r\\nof the papers of ex-President Murillo, and also the shocking affair of\\r\\nthe Dutch steamship FRIESLAND, which so nearly cost us both our lives.\\r\\nHis cold and proud nature was always averse, however, from anything\\r\\nin the shape of public applause, and he bound me in the most\\r\\nstringent terms to say no further word of himself, his methods, or his\\r\\nsuccesses--a prohibition which, as I have explained, has only now been\\r\\nremoved.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical\\r\\nprotest, and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion,\\r\\nwhen our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell,\\r\\nfollowed immediately by a hollow drumming sound, as if someone were\\r\\nbeating on the outer door with his fist. As it opened there came a\\r\\ntumultuous rush into the hall, rapid feet clattered up the stair, and an\\r\\ninstant later a wild-eyed and frantic young man, pale, disheveled, and\\r\\npalpitating, burst into the room. He looked from one to the other of us,\\r\\nand under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was\\r\\nneeded for this unceremonious entry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes,” he cried. “You mustn’t blame me. I am nearly\\r\\nmad. Mr. Holmes, I am the unhappy John Hector McFarlane.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his\\r\\nvisit and its manner, but I could see, by my companion’s unresponsive\\r\\nface, that it meant no more to him than to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane,” said he, pushing his case across.\\r\\n“I am sure that, with your symptoms, my friend Dr. Watson here would\\r\\nprescribe a sedative. The weather has been so very warm these last few\\r\\ndays. Now, if you feel a little more composed, I should be glad if you\\r\\nwould sit down in that chair, and tell us very slowly and quietly who\\r\\nyou are, and what it is that you want. You mentioned your name, as if\\r\\nI should recognize it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts\\r\\nthat you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I\\r\\nknow nothing whatever about you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFamiliar as I was with my friend’s methods, it was not difficult for me\\r\\nto follow his deductions, and to observe the untidiness of attire, the\\r\\nsheaf of legal papers, the watch-charm, and the breathing which had\\r\\nprompted them. Our client, however, stared in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am all that, Mr. Holmes; and, in addition, I am the most\\r\\nunfortunate man at this moment in London. For heaven’s sake, don’t\\r\\nabandon me, Mr. Holmes! If they come to arrest me before I have finished\\r\\nmy story, make them give me time, so that I may tell you the whole\\r\\ntruth. I could go to jail happy if I knew that you were working for me\\r\\noutside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Arrest you!” said Holmes. “This is really most grati--most interesting.\\r\\nOn what charge do you expect to be arrested?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon the charge of murdering Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower Norwood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion’s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not, I am\\r\\nafraid, entirely unmixed with satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me,” said he, “it was only this moment at breakfast that I was\\r\\nsaying to my friend, Dr. Watson, that sensational cases had disappeared\\r\\nout of our papers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the DAILY\\r\\nTELEGRAPH, which still lay upon Holmes’s knee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you had looked at it, sir, you would have seen at a glance what the\\r\\nerrand is on which I have come to you this morning. I feel as if my name\\r\\nand my misfortune must be in every man’s mouth.” He turned it over to\\r\\nexpose the central page. “Here it is, and with your permission I\\r\\nwill read it to you. Listen to this, Mr. Holmes. The headlines are:\\r\\n‘Mysterious Affair at Lower Norwood. Disappearance of a Well Known\\r\\nBuilder. Suspicion of Murder and Arson. A Clue to the Criminal.’ That is\\r\\nthe clue which they are already following, Mr. Holmes, and I know that\\r\\nit leads infallibly to me. I have been followed from London Bridge\\r\\nStation, and I am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to\\r\\narrest me. It will break my mother’s heart--it will break her heart!”\\r\\n He wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension, and swayed backward and\\r\\nforward in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked with interest upon this man, who was accused of being the\\r\\nperpetrator of a crime of violence. He was flaxen-haired and handsome,\\r\\nin a washed-out negative fashion, with frightened blue eyes, and a\\r\\nclean-shaven face, with a weak, sensitive mouth. His age may have been\\r\\nabout twenty-seven, his dress and bearing that of a gentleman. From the\\r\\npocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of indorsed\\r\\npapers which proclaimed his profession.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must use what time we have,” said Holmes. “Watson, would you have\\r\\nthe kindness to take the paper and to read the paragraph in question?”\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted, I read\\r\\nthe following suggestive narrative:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Late last night, or early this morning, an incident occurred at Lower\\r\\nNorwood which points, it is feared, to a serious crime. Mr. Jonas\\r\\nOldacre is a well known resident of that suburb, where he has carried\\r\\non his business as a builder for many years. Mr. Oldacre is a bachelor,\\r\\nfifty-two years of age, and lives in Deep Dene House, at the Sydenham\\r\\nend of the road of that name. He has had the reputation of being a\\r\\nman of eccentric habits, secretive and retiring. For some years he has\\r\\npractically withdrawn from the business, in which he is said to have\\r\\nmassed considerable wealth. A small timber-yard still exists, however,\\r\\nat the back of the house, and last night, about twelve o’clock, an alarm\\r\\nwas given that one of the stacks was on fire. The engines were soon upon\\r\\nthe spot, but the dry wood burned with great fury, and it was impossible\\r\\nto arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed.\\r\\nUp to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary\\r\\naccident, but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime. Surprise\\r\\nwas expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from\\r\\nthe scene of the fire, and an inquiry followed, which showed that he had\\r\\ndisappeared from the house. An examination of his room revealed that the\\r\\nbed had not been slept in, that a safe which stood in it was open, that\\r\\na number of important papers were scattered about the room, and finally,\\r\\nthat there were signs of a murderous struggle, slight traces of blood\\r\\nbeing found within the room, and an oaken walking-stick, which also\\r\\nshowed stains of blood upon the handle. It is known that Mr. Jonas\\r\\nOldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night, and\\r\\nthe stick found has been identified as the property of this person, who\\r\\nis a young London solicitor named John Hector McFarlane, junior partner\\r\\nof Graham and McFarlane, of 426 Gresham Buildings, E. C. The police\\r\\nbelieve that they have evidence in their possession which supplies\\r\\na very convincing motive for the crime, and altogether it cannot be\\r\\ndoubted that sensational developments will follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“LATER.--It is rumoured as we go to press that Mr. John Hector McFarlane\\r\\nhas actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of Mr. Jonas\\r\\nOldacre. It is at least certain that a warrant has been issued. There\\r\\nhave been further and sinister developments in the investigation at\\r\\nNorwood. Besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate\\r\\nbuilder it is now known that the French windows of his bedroom (which is\\r\\non the ground floor) were found to be open, that there were marks as\\r\\nif some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood-pile, and,\\r\\nfinally, it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the\\r\\ncharcoal ashes of the fire. The police theory is that a most sensational\\r\\ncrime has been committed, that the victim was clubbed to death in his\\r\\nown bedroom, his papers rifled, and his dead body dragged across to\\r\\nthe wood-stack, which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the\\r\\ncrime. The conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in\\r\\nthe experienced hands of Inspector Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, who is\\r\\nfollowing up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together to\\r\\nthis remarkable account.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The case has certainly some points of interest,” said he, in his\\r\\nlanguid fashion. “May I ask, in the first place, Mr. McFarlane, how\\r\\nit is that you are still at liberty, since there appears to be enough\\r\\nevidence to justify your arrest?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I live at Torrington Lodge, Blackheath, with my parents, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nbut last night, having to do business very late with Mr. Jonas Oldacre,\\r\\nI stayed at an hotel in Norwood, and came to my business from there. I\\r\\nknew nothing of this affair until I was in the train, when I read what\\r\\nyou have just heard. I at once saw the horrible danger of my position,\\r\\nand I hurried to put the case into your hands. I have no doubt that I\\r\\nshould have been arrested either at my city office or at my home. A\\r\\nman followed me from London Bridge Station, and I have no doubt--Great\\r\\nheaven! what is that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a clang of the bell, followed instantly by heavy steps upon the\\r\\nstair. A moment later, our old friend Lestrade appeared in the doorway.\\r\\nOver his shoulder I caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen\\r\\noutside.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. John Hector McFarlane?” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I arrest you for the wilful murder of Mr. Jonas Oldacre, of Lower\\r\\nNorwood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMcFarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair, and sank into his\\r\\nchair once more like one who is crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “Half an hour more or less can make\\r\\nno difference to you, and the gentleman was about to give us an account\\r\\nof this very interesting affair, which might aid us in clearing it up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up,” said Lestrade,\\r\\ngrimly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“None the less, with your permission, I should be much interested to\\r\\nhear his account.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, it is difficult for me to refuse you anything, for\\r\\nyou have been of use to the force once or twice in the past, and we owe\\r\\nyou a good turn at Scotland Yard,” said Lestrade. “At the same time I\\r\\nmust remain with my prisoner, and I am bound to warn him that anything\\r\\nhe may say will appear in evidence against him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish nothing better,” said our client. “All I ask is that you should\\r\\nhear and recognize the absolute truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked at his watch. “I’ll give you half an hour,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must explain first,” said McFarlane, “that I knew nothing of Mr.\\r\\nJonas Oldacre. His name was familiar to me, for many years ago my\\r\\nparents were acquainted with him, but they drifted apart. I was very\\r\\nmuch surprised therefore, when yesterday, about three o’clock in the\\r\\nafternoon, he walked into my office in the city. But I was still more\\r\\nastonished when he told me the object of his visit. He had in his hand\\r\\nseveral sheets of a notebook, covered with scribbled writing--here they\\r\\nare--and he laid them on my table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Here is my will,’ said he. ‘I want you, Mr. McFarlane, to cast it into\\r\\nproper legal shape. I will sit here while you do so.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“I set myself to copy it, and you can imagine my astonishment when I\\r\\nfound that, with some reservations, he had left all his property to me.\\r\\nHe was a strange little ferret-like man, with white eyelashes, and when\\r\\nI looked up at him I found his keen gray eyes fixed upon me with an\\r\\namused expression. I could hardly believe my own as I read the terms of\\r\\nthe will; but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living\\r\\nrelation, that he had known my parents in his youth, and that he had\\r\\nalways heard of me as a very deserving young man, and was assured that\\r\\nhis money would be in worthy hands. Of course, I could only stammer\\r\\nout my thanks. The will was duly finished, signed, and witnessed by\\r\\nmy clerk. This is it on the blue paper, and these slips, as I have\\r\\nexplained, are the rough draft. Mr. Jonas Oldacre then informed me\\r\\nthat there were a number of documents--building leases, title-deeds,\\r\\nmortgages, scrip, and so forth--which it was necessary that I should see\\r\\nand understand. He said that his mind would not be easy until the whole\\r\\nthing was settled, and he begged me to come out to his house at\\r\\nNorwood that night, bringing the will with me, and to arrange matters.\\r\\n‘Remember, my boy, not one word to your parents about the affair until\\r\\neverything is settled. We will keep it as a little surprise for\\r\\nthem.’ He was very insistent upon this point, and made me promise it\\r\\nfaithfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can imagine, Mr. Holmes, that I was not in a humour to refuse him\\r\\nanything that he might ask. He was my benefactor, and all my desire was\\r\\nto carry out his wishes in every particular. I sent a telegram home,\\r\\ntherefore, to say that I had important business on hand, and that it was\\r\\nimpossible for me to say how late I might be. Mr. Oldacre had told me\\r\\nthat he would like me to have supper with him at nine, as he might not\\r\\nbe home before that hour. I had some difficulty in finding his house,\\r\\nhowever, and it was nearly half-past before I reached it. I found\\r\\nhim----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment!” said Holmes. “Who opened the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A middle-aged woman, who was, I suppose, his housekeeper.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And it was she, I presume, who mentioned your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly,” said McFarlane.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray proceed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMcFarlane wiped his damp brow, and then continued his narrative:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was shown by this woman into a sitting-room, where a frugal supper\\r\\nwas laid out. Afterwards, Mr. Jonas Oldacre led me into his bedroom, in\\r\\nwhich there stood a heavy safe. This he opened and took out a mass of\\r\\ndocuments, which we went over together. It was between eleven and twelve\\r\\nwhen we finished. He remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper.\\r\\nHe showed me out through his own French window, which had been open all\\r\\nthis time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the blind down?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not be sure, but I believe that it was only half down. Yes, I\\r\\nremember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window. I could\\r\\nnot find my stick, and he said, ‘Never mind, my boy, I shall see a good\\r\\ndeal of you now, I hope, and I will keep your stick until you come back\\r\\nto claim it.’ I left him there, the safe open, and the papers made up\\r\\nin packets upon the table. It was so late that I could not get back to\\r\\nBlackheath, so I spent the night at the Anerley Arms, and I knew nothing\\r\\nmore until I read of this horrible affair in the morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anything more that you would like to ask, Mr. Holmes?” said Lestrade,\\r\\nwhose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable\\r\\nexplanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not until I have been to Blackheath.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean to Norwood,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, no doubt that is what I must have meant,” said Holmes, with\\r\\nhis enigmatical smile. Lestrade had learned by more experiences than he\\r\\nwould care to acknowledge that that brain could cut through that which\\r\\nwas impenetrable to him. I saw him look curiously at my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I should like to have a word with you presently, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes,” said he. “Now, Mr. McFarlane, two of my constables are at\\r\\nthe door, and there is a four-wheeler waiting.” The wretched young man\\r\\narose, and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room. The\\r\\nofficers conducted him to the cab, but Lestrade remained.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will,\\r\\nand was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are some points about that document, Lestrade, are there not?”\\r\\n said he, pushing them over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official looked at them with a puzzled expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the second\\r\\npage, and one or two at the end. Those are as clear as print,” said\\r\\nhe, “but the writing in between is very bad, and there are three places\\r\\nwhere I cannot read it at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what do YOU make of it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That it was written in a train. The good writing represents stations,\\r\\nthe bad writing movement, and the very bad writing passing over points.\\r\\nA scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a\\r\\nsuburban line, since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great\\r\\ncity could there be so quick a succession of points. Granting that his\\r\\nwhole journey was occupied in drawing up the will, then the train was an\\r\\nexpress, only stopping once between Norwood and London Bridge.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade began to laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes,” said he. “How does this bear on the case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it corroborates the young man’s story to the extent that the\\r\\nwill was drawn up by Jonas Oldacre in his journey yesterday. It is\\r\\ncurious--is it not?--that a man should draw up so important a document\\r\\nin so haphazard a fashion. It suggests that he did not think it was\\r\\ngoing to be of much practical importance. If a man drew up a will which\\r\\nhe did not intend ever to be effective, he might do it so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he drew up his own death warrant at the same time,” said\\r\\nLestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you think so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is quite possible, but the case is not clear to me yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not clear? Well, if that isn’t clear, what COULD be clear? Here is a\\r\\nyoung man who learns suddenly that, if a certain older man dies, he will\\r\\nsucceed to a fortune. What does he do? He says nothing to anyone, but\\r\\nhe arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that\\r\\nnight. He waits until the only other person in the house is in bed, and\\r\\nthen in the solitude of a man’s room he murders him, burns his body in\\r\\nthe wood-pile, and departs to a neighbouring hotel. The blood-stains in\\r\\nthe room and also on the stick are very slight. It is probable that he\\r\\nimagined his crime to be a bloodless one, and hoped that if the\\r\\nbody were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his\\r\\ndeath--traces which, for some reason, must have pointed to him. Is not\\r\\nall this obvious?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It strikes me, my good Lestrade, as being just a trifle too obvious,”\\r\\n said Holmes. “You do not add imagination to your other great qualities,\\r\\nbut if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young\\r\\nman, would you choose the very night after the will had been made to\\r\\ncommit your crime? Would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very\\r\\nclose a relation between the two incidents? Again, would you choose an\\r\\noccasion when you are known to be in the house, when a servant has let\\r\\nyou in? And, finally, would you take the great pains to conceal the\\r\\nbody, and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal?\\r\\nConfess, Lestrade, that all this is very unlikely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As to the stick, Mr. Holmes, you know as well as I do that a criminal\\r\\nis often flurried, and does such things, which a cool man would avoid.\\r\\nHe was very likely afraid to go back to the room. Give me another theory\\r\\nthat would fit the facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could very easily give you half a dozen,” said Holmes. “Here for\\r\\nexample, is a very possible and even probable one. I make you a free\\r\\npresent of it. The older man is showing documents which are of evident\\r\\nvalue. A passing tramp sees them through the window, the blind of which\\r\\nis only half down. Exit the solicitor. Enter the tramp! He seizes a\\r\\nstick, which he observes there, kills Oldacre, and departs after burning\\r\\nthe body.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should the tramp burn the body?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For the matter of that, why should McFarlane?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To hide some evidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been\\r\\ncommitted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why did the tramp take nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because they were papers that he could not negotiate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade shook his head, though it seemed to me that his manner was less\\r\\nabsolutely assured than before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, you may look for your tramp, and while you\\r\\nare finding him we will hold on to our man. The future will show which\\r\\nis right. Just notice this point, Mr. Holmes: that so far as we know,\\r\\nnone of the papers were removed, and that the prisoner is the one man in\\r\\nthe world who had no reason for removing them, since he was heir-at-law,\\r\\nand would come into them in any case.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend seemed struck by this remark.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly\\r\\nin favour of your theory,” said he. “I only wish to point out that\\r\\nthere are other theories possible. As you say, the future will decide.\\r\\nGood-morning! I dare say that in the course of the day I shall drop in\\r\\nat Norwood and see how you are getting on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the detective departed, my friend rose and made his preparations\\r\\nfor the day’s work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task\\r\\nbefore him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My first movement Watson,” said he, as he bustled into his frockcoat,\\r\\n“must, as I said, be in the direction of Blackheath.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why not Norwood?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the\\r\\nheels of another singular incident. The police are making the mistake of\\r\\nconcentrating their attention upon the second, because it happens to\\r\\nbe the one which is actually criminal. But it is evident to me that the\\r\\nlogical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some\\r\\nlight upon the first incident--the curious will, so suddenly made, and\\r\\nto so unexpected an heir. It may do something to simplify what followed.\\r\\nNo, my dear fellow, I don’t think you can help me. There is no prospect\\r\\nof danger, or I should not dream of stirring out without you. I trust\\r\\nthat when I see you in the evening, I will be able to report that I have\\r\\nbeen able to do something for this unfortunate youngster, who has thrown\\r\\nhimself upon my protection.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was late when my friend returned, and I could see, by a glance at his\\r\\nhaggard and anxious face, that the high hopes with which he had started\\r\\nhad not been fulfilled. For an hour he droned away upon his violin,\\r\\nendeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits. At last he flung\\r\\ndown the instrument, and plunged into a detailed account of his\\r\\nmisadventures.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all going wrong, Watson--all as wrong as it can go. I kept a bold\\r\\nface before Lestrade, but, upon my soul, I believe that for once the\\r\\nfellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong. All my instincts\\r\\nare one way, and all the facts are the other, and I much fear that\\r\\nBritish juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when\\r\\nthey will give the preference to my theories over Lestrade’s facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you go to Blackheath?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Watson, I went there, and I found very quickly that the late\\r\\nlamented Oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard. The father was\\r\\naway in search of his son. The mother was at home--a little, fluffy,\\r\\nblue-eyed person, in a tremor of fear and indignation. Of course, she\\r\\nwould not admit even the possibility of his guilt. But she would not\\r\\nexpress either surprise or regret over the fate of Oldacre. On\\r\\nthe contrary, she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was\\r\\nunconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police for, of\\r\\ncourse, if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion, it\\r\\nwould predispose him towards hatred and violence. ‘He was more like a\\r\\nmalignant and cunning ape than a human being,’ said she, ‘and he always\\r\\nwas, ever since he was a young man.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You knew him at that time?’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes, I knew him well, in fact, he was an old suitor of mine. Thank\\r\\nheaven that I had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a\\r\\nbetter, if poorer, man. I was engaged to him, Mr. Holmes, when I heard a\\r\\nshocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary, and I was\\r\\nso horrified at his brutal cruelty that I would have nothing more to\\r\\ndo with him.’ She rummaged in a bureau, and presently she produced a\\r\\nphotograph of a woman, shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife.\\r\\n‘That is my own photograph,’ she said. ‘He sent it to me in that state,\\r\\nwith his curse, upon my wedding morning.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well,’ said I, ‘at least he has forgiven you now, since he has left\\r\\nall his property to your son.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Neither my son nor I want anything from Jonas Oldacre, dead or alive!’\\r\\nshe cried, with a proper spirit. ‘There is a God in heaven, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nand that same God who has punished that wicked man will show, in His own\\r\\ngood time, that my son’s hands are guiltless of his blood.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I tried one or two leads, but could get at nothing which would\\r\\nhelp our hypothesis, and several points which would make against it. I\\r\\ngave it up at last and off I went to Norwood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This place, Deep Dene House, is a big modern villa of staring brick,\\r\\nstanding back in its own grounds, with a laurel-clumped lawn in front\\r\\nof it. To the right and some distance back from the road was the\\r\\ntimber-yard which had been the scene of the fire. Here’s a rough plan\\r\\non a leaf of my notebook. This window on the left is the one which opens\\r\\ninto Oldacre’s room. You can look into it from the road, you see. That\\r\\nis about the only bit of consolation I have had to-day. Lestrade was\\r\\nnot there, but his head constable did the honours. They had just found a\\r\\ngreat treasure-trove. They had spent the morning raking among the ashes\\r\\nof the burned wood-pile, and besides the charred organic remains they\\r\\nhad secured several discoloured metal discs. I examined them with\\r\\ncare, and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons. I even\\r\\ndistinguished that one of them was marked with the name of ‘Hyams,’ who\\r\\nwas Oldacres tailor. I then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and\\r\\ntraces, but this drought has made everything as hard as iron. Nothing\\r\\nwas to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through\\r\\na low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood-pile. All that, of\\r\\ncourse, fits in with the official theory. I crawled about the lawn with\\r\\nan August sun on my back, but I got up at the end of an hour no wiser\\r\\nthan before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, after this fiasco I went into the bedroom and examined that also.\\r\\nThe blood-stains were very slight, mere smears and discolourations, but\\r\\nundoubtedly fresh. The stick had been removed, but there also the marks\\r\\nwere slight. There is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client.\\r\\nHe admits it. Footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet,\\r\\nbut none of any third person, which again is a trick for the other\\r\\nside. They were piling up their score all the time and we were at a\\r\\nstandstill.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only one little gleam of hope did I get--and yet it amounted to\\r\\nnothing. I examined the contents of the safe, most of which had been\\r\\ntaken out and left on the table. The papers had been made up into sealed\\r\\nenvelopes, one or two of which had been opened by the police. They were\\r\\nnot, so far as I could judge, of any great value, nor did the bank-book\\r\\nshow that Mr. Oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances. But it\\r\\nseemed to me that all the papers were not there. There were allusions to\\r\\nsome deeds--possibly the more valuable--which I could not find. This, of\\r\\ncourse, if we could definitely prove it, would turn Lestrade’s argument\\r\\nagainst himself, for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would\\r\\nshortly inherit it?\\r\\n\\r\\n“Finally, having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent, I tried\\r\\nmy luck with the housekeeper. Mrs. Lexington is her name--a little,\\r\\ndark, silent person, with suspicious and sidelong eyes. She could tell\\r\\nus something if she would--I am convinced of it. But she was as close as\\r\\nwax. Yes, she had let Mr. McFarlane in at half-past nine. She wished\\r\\nher hand had withered before she had done so. She had gone to bed at\\r\\nhalf-past ten. Her room was at the other end of the house, and she could\\r\\nhear nothing of what had passed. Mr. McFarlane had left his hat, and to\\r\\nthe best of her belief his stick, in the hall.  She\\r\\nhad been awakened by the alarm of fire. Her poor, dear\\r\\nmaster had certainly been murdered. Had he any enemies? Well, every man\\r\\nhad enemies, but Mr. Oldacre kept himself very much to himself, and only\\r\\nmet people in the way of business. She had seen the buttons, and was\\r\\nsure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night.\\r\\nThe wood-pile was very dry, for it had not rained for a month. It burned\\r\\nlike tinder, and by the time she reached the spot, nothing could be seen\\r\\nbut flames. She and all the firemen smelled the burned flesh from\\r\\ninside it. She knew nothing of the papers, nor of Mr. Oldacre’s private\\r\\naffairs.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, my dear Watson, there’s my report of a failure. And yet--and yet--”\\r\\n he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction--“I KNOW it’s all\\r\\nwrong. I feel it in my bones. There is something that has not come out,\\r\\nand that housekeeper knows it. There was a sort of sulky defiance in her\\r\\neyes, which only goes with guilty knowledge. However, there’s no good\\r\\ntalking any more about it, Watson; but unless some lucky chance comes\\r\\nour way I fear that the Norwood Disappearance Case will not figure in\\r\\nthat chronicle of our successes which I foresee that a patient public\\r\\nwill sooner or later have to endure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely,” said I, “the man’s appearance would go far with any jury?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is a dangerous argument my dear Watson. You remember that terrible\\r\\nmurderer, Bert Stevens, who wanted us to get him off in ‘87? Was there\\r\\never a more mild-mannered, Sunday-school young man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory, this man is\\r\\nlost. You can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented\\r\\nagainst him, and all further investigation has served to strengthen it.\\r\\nBy the way, there is one curious little point about those papers which\\r\\nmay serve us as the starting-point for an inquiry. On looking over the\\r\\nbank-book I found that the low state of the balance was principally due\\r\\nto large checks which have been made out during the last year to Mr.\\r\\nCornelius. I confess that I should be interested to know who this\\r\\nMr. Cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large\\r\\ntransactions. Is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair?\\r\\nCornelius might be a broker, but we have found no scrip to correspond\\r\\nwith these large payments. Failing any other indication, my researches\\r\\nmust now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman\\r\\nwho has cashed these checks. But I fear, my dear fellow, that our\\r\\ncase will end ingloriously by Lestrade hanging our client, which will\\r\\ncertainly be a triumph for Scotland Yard.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know how far Sherlock Holmes took any sleep that night, but\\r\\nwhen I came down to breakfast I found him pale and harassed, his bright\\r\\neyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them. The carpet round his\\r\\nchair was littered with cigarette-ends and with the early editions of\\r\\nthe morning papers. An open telegram lay upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of this, Watson?” he asked, tossing it across.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was from Norwood, and ran as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImportant fresh evidence to hand. McFarlane’s guilt definitely\\r\\nestablished. Advise you to abandon case. LESTRADE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“This sounds serious,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is Lestrade’s little cock-a-doodle of victory,” Holmes answered,\\r\\nwith a bitter smile. “And yet it may be premature to abandon the case.\\r\\nAfter all, important fresh evidence is a two-edged thing, and may\\r\\npossibly cut in a very different direction to that which Lestrade\\r\\nimagines. Take your breakfast, Watson, and we will go out together and\\r\\nsee what we can do. I feel as if I shall need your company and your\\r\\nmoral support today.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend had no breakfast himself, for it was one of his peculiarities\\r\\nthat in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food, and I\\r\\nhave known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from\\r\\npure inanition. “At present I cannot spare energy and nerve force for\\r\\ndigestion,” he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances. I was\\r\\nnot surprised, therefore, when this morning he left his untouched\\r\\nmeal behind him, and started with me for Norwood. A crowd of morbid\\r\\nsightseers were still gathered round Deep Dene House, which was just\\r\\nsuch a suburban villa as I had pictured. Within the gates Lestrade met\\r\\nus, his face flushed with victory, his manner grossly triumphant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, have you proved us to be wrong yet? Have you found\\r\\nyour tramp?” he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have formed no conclusion whatever,” my companion answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we formed ours yesterday, and now it proves to be correct, so you\\r\\nmust acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time,\\r\\nMr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred,” said\\r\\nHolmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed loudly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t like being beaten any more than the rest of us do,” said he.\\r\\n“A man can’t expect always to have it his own way, can he, Dr. Watson?\\r\\nStep this way, if you please, gentlemen, and I think I can convince you\\r\\nonce for all that it was John McFarlane who did this crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is where young McFarlane must have come out to get his hat\\r\\nafter the crime was done,” said he. “Now look at this.” With dramatic\\r\\nsuddenness he struck a match, and by its light exposed a stain of blood\\r\\nupon the whitewashed wall. As he held the match nearer, I saw that it\\r\\nwas more than a stain. It was the well-marked print of a thumb.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that with your magnifying glass, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am doing so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are aware that no two thumb-marks are alike?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have heard something of the kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, will you please compare that print with this wax impression\\r\\nof young McFarlane’s right thumb, taken by my orders this morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he held the waxen print close to the blood-stain, it did not take\\r\\na magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same\\r\\nthumb. It was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is final,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is final,” I involuntarily echoed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is final,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething in his tone caught my ear, and I turned to look at him. An\\r\\nextraordinary change had come over his face. It was writhing with inward\\r\\nmerriment. His two eyes were shining like stars. It seemed to me that\\r\\nhe was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me! Dear me!” he said at last. “Well, now, who would have thought\\r\\nit? And how deceptive appearances may be, to be sure! Such a nice young\\r\\nman to look at! It is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment, is\\r\\nit not, Lestrade?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, some of us are a little too much inclined to be cock-sure, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes,” said Lestrade. The man’s insolence was maddening, but we could\\r\\nnot resent it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a providential thing that this young man should press his right\\r\\nthumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg! Such a very\\r\\nnatural action, too, if you come to think of it.” Holmes was outwardly\\r\\ncalm, but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the way, Lestrade, who made this remarkable discovery?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was the housekeeper, Mrs. Lexington, who drew the night constable’s\\r\\nattention to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was the night constable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed, so\\r\\nas to see that nothing was touched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why didn’t the police see this mark yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the\\r\\nhall. Besides, it’s not in a very prominent place, as you see.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no--of course not. I suppose there is no doubt that the mark was\\r\\nthere yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked at Holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind.\\r\\nI confess that I was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and\\r\\nat his rather wild observation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know whether you think that McFarlane came out of jail in the\\r\\ndead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself,”\\r\\n said Lestrade. “I leave it to any expert in the world whether that is\\r\\nnot the mark of his thumb.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is unquestionably the mark of his thumb.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, that’s enough,” said Lestrade. “I am a practical man, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, and when I have got my evidence I come to my conclusions. If\\r\\nyou have anything to say, you will find me writing my report in the\\r\\nsitting-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had recovered his equanimity, though I still seemed to detect\\r\\ngleams of amusement in his expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, this is a very sad development, Watson, is it not?” said he.\\r\\n“And yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes\\r\\nfor our client.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am delighted to hear it,” said I, heartily. “I was afraid it was all\\r\\nup with him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I would hardly go so far as to say that, my dear Watson. The fact is\\r\\nthat there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our\\r\\nfriend attaches so much importance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed, Holmes! What is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only this: that I KNOW that that mark was not there when I examined the\\r\\nhall yesterday. And now, Watson, let us have a little stroll round in\\r\\nthe sunshine.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a confused brain, but with a heart into which some warmth of hope\\r\\nwas returning, I accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden.\\r\\nHolmes took each face of the house in turn, and examined it with great\\r\\ninterest. He then led the way inside, and went over the whole building\\r\\nfrom basement to attic. Most of the rooms were unfurnished, but none the\\r\\nless Holmes inspected them all minutely. Finally, on the top corridor,\\r\\nwhich ran outside three untenanted bedrooms, he again was seized with a\\r\\nspasm of merriment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are really some very unique features about this case, Watson,”\\r\\n said he. “I think it is time now that we took our friend Lestrade into\\r\\nour confidence. He has had his little smile at our expense, and perhaps\\r\\nwe may do as much by him, if my reading of this problem proves to be\\r\\ncorrect. Yes, yes, I think I see how we should approach it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Scotland Yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when Holmes\\r\\ninterrupted him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understood that you were writing a report of this case,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you think it may be a little premature? I can’t help thinking\\r\\nthat your evidence is not complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words. He laid down\\r\\nhis pen and looked curiously at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you produce him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will do my best. How many constables have you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are three within call.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” said Holmes. “May I ask if they are all large, able-bodied\\r\\nmen with powerful voices?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no doubt they are, though I fail to see what their voices have\\r\\nto do with it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I can help you to see that and one or two other things as\\r\\nwell,” said Holmes. “Kindly summon your men, and I will try.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFive minutes later, three policemen had assembled in the hall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “I will ask you to carry in two bundles of it. I think it will\\r\\nbe of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom I require.\\r\\nThank you very much. I believe you have some matches in your pocket\\r\\nWatson. Now, Mr. Lestrade, I will ask you all to accompany me to the top\\r\\nlanding.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I have said, there was a broad corridor there, which ran outside\\r\\nthree empty bedrooms. At one end of the corridor we were all marshalled\\r\\nby Sherlock Holmes, the constables grinning and Lestrade staring at\\r\\nmy friend with amazement, expectation, and derision chasing each other\\r\\nacross his features. Holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer\\r\\nwho is performing a trick.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water?\\r\\nPut the straw on the floor here, free from the wall on either side. Now\\r\\nI think that we are all ready.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade’s face had begun to grow red and angry. “I don’t know whether\\r\\nyou are playing a game with us, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said he. “If you\\r\\nknow anything, you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I assure you, my good Lestrade, that I have an excellent reason for\\r\\neverything that I do. You may possibly remember that you chaffed me a\\r\\nlittle, some hours ago, when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge,\\r\\nso you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now. Might I ask\\r\\nyou, Watson, to open that window, and then to put a match to the edge of\\r\\nthe straw?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so, and driven by the draught a coil of gray smoke swirled down\\r\\nthe corridor, while the dry straw crackled and flamed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now we must see if we can find this witness for you, Lestrade. Might\\r\\nI ask you all to join in the cry of ‘Fire!’? Now then; one, two,\\r\\nthree----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire!” we all yelled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you. I will trouble you once again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just once more, gentlemen, and all together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fire!” The shout must have rung over Norwood.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened. A door suddenly\\r\\nflew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the\\r\\ncorridor, and a little, wizened man darted out of it, like a rabbit out\\r\\nof its burrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Capital!” said Holmes, calmly. “Watson, a bucket of water over the\\r\\nstraw. That will do! Lestrade, allow me to present you with your\\r\\nprincipal missing witness, Mr. Jonas Oldacre.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement. The latter\\r\\nwas blinking in the bright light of the corridor, and peering at us\\r\\nand at the smouldering fire. It was an odious face--crafty, vicious,\\r\\nmalignant, with shifty, light-gray eyes and white lashes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What’s this, then?” said Lestrade, at last. “What have you been doing\\r\\nall this time, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOldacre gave an uneasy laugh, shrinking back from the furious red face\\r\\nof the angry detective.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have done no harm.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No harm? You have done your best to get an innocent man hanged. If it\\r\\nwasn’t for this gentleman here, I am not sure that you would not have\\r\\nsucceeded.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wretched creature began to whimper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure, sir, it was only my practical joke.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! a joke, was it? You won’t find the laugh on your side, I promise\\r\\nyou. Take him down, and keep him in the sitting-room until I come. Mr.\\r\\nHolmes,” he continued, when they had gone, “I could not speak before the\\r\\nconstables, but I don’t mind saying, in the presence of Dr. Watson,\\r\\nthat this is the brightest thing that you have done yet, though it is a\\r\\nmystery to me how you did it. You have saved an innocent man’s life,\\r\\nand you have prevented a very grave scandal, which would have ruined my\\r\\nreputation in the Force.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled, and clapped Lestrade upon the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Instead of being ruined, my good sir, you will find that your\\r\\nreputation has been enormously enhanced. Just make a few alterations in\\r\\nthat report which you were writing, and they will understand how hard it\\r\\nis to throw dust in the eyes of Inspector Lestrade.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you don’t want your name to appear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. The work is its own reward. Perhaps I shall get the credit\\r\\nalso at some distant day, when I permit my zealous historian to lay out\\r\\nhis foolscap once more--eh, Watson? Well, now, let us see where this rat\\r\\nhas been lurking.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA lath-and-plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet\\r\\nfrom the end, with a door cunningly concealed in it. It was lit within\\r\\nby slits under the eaves. A few articles of furniture and a supply of\\r\\nfood and water were within, together with a number of books and papers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s the advantage of being a builder,” said Holmes, as we came\\r\\nout. “He was able to fix up his own little hiding-place without any\\r\\nconfederate--save, of course, that precious housekeeper of his, whom I\\r\\nshould lose no time in adding to your bag, Lestrade.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll take your advice. But how did you know of this place, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house. When I\\r\\npaced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding\\r\\none below, it was pretty clear where he was. I thought he had not the\\r\\nnerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire. We could, of course, have\\r\\ngone in and taken him, but it amused me to make him reveal himself.\\r\\nBesides, I owed you a little mystification, Lestrade, for your chaff in\\r\\nthe morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir, you certainly got equal with me on that. But how in the\\r\\nworld did you know that he was in the house at all?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The thumb-mark, Lestrade. You said it was final; and so it was, in a\\r\\nvery different sense. I knew it had not been there the day before. I pay\\r\\na good deal of attention to matters of detail, as you may have observed,\\r\\nand I had examined the hall, and was sure that the wall was clear.\\r\\nTherefore, it had been put on during the night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very simply. When those packets were sealed up, Jonas Oldacre got\\r\\nMcFarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft\\r\\nwax. It would be done so quickly and so naturally, that I daresay the\\r\\nyoung man himself has no recollection of it. Very likely it just so\\r\\nhappened, and Oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it\\r\\nto. Brooding over the case in that den of his, it suddenly struck him\\r\\nwhat absolutely damning evidence he could make against McFarlane by\\r\\nusing that thumb-mark. It was the simplest thing in the world for him to\\r\\ntake a wax impression from the seal, to moisten it in as much blood as\\r\\nhe could get from a pin-prick, and to put the mark upon the wall during\\r\\nthe night, either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper.\\r\\nIf you examine among those documents which he took with him into\\r\\nhis retreat, I will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the\\r\\nthumb-mark upon it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” said Lestrade. “Wonderful! It’s all as clear as crystal, as\\r\\nyou put it. But what is the object of this deep deception, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was amusing to me to see how the detective’s overbearing manner had\\r\\nchanged suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t think that is very hard to explain. A very deep,\\r\\nmalicious, vindictive person is the gentleman who is now waiting us\\r\\ndownstairs. You know that he was once refused by McFarlane’s mother?\\r\\nYou don’t! I told you that you should go to Blackheath first and Norwood\\r\\nafterwards. Well, this injury, as he would consider it, has rankled\\r\\nin his wicked, scheming brain, and all his life he has longed for\\r\\nvengeance, but never seen his chance. During the last year or two,\\r\\nthings have gone against him--secret speculation, I think--and he finds\\r\\nhimself in a bad way. He determines to swindle his creditors, and for\\r\\nthis purpose he pays large checks to a certain Mr. Cornelius, who is, I\\r\\nimagine, himself under another name. I have not traced these checks\\r\\nyet, but I have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some\\r\\nprovincial town where Oldacre from time to time led a double existence.\\r\\nHe intended to change his name altogether, draw this money, and vanish,\\r\\nstarting life again elsewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s likely enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off\\r\\nhis track, and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon\\r\\nhis old sweetheart, if he could give the impression that he had been\\r\\nmurdered by her only child. It was a masterpiece of villainy, and he\\r\\ncarried it out like a master. The idea of the will, which would give\\r\\nan obvious motive for the crime, the secret visit unknown to his own\\r\\nparents, the retention of the stick, the blood, and the animal remains\\r\\nand buttons in the wood-pile, all were admirable. It was a net from\\r\\nwhich it seemed to me, a few hours ago, that there was no possible\\r\\nescape. But he had not that supreme gift of the artist, the knowledge\\r\\nof when to stop. He wished to improve that which was already perfect--to\\r\\ndraw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim--and\\r\\nso he ruined all. Let us descend, Lestrade. There are just one or two\\r\\nquestions that I would ask him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe malignant creature was seated in his own parlour, with a policeman\\r\\nupon each side of him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a joke, my good sir--a practical joke, nothing more,” he whined\\r\\nincessantly. “I assure you, sir, that I simply concealed myself in order\\r\\nto see the effect of my disappearance, and I am sure that you would not\\r\\nbe so unjust as to imagine that I would have allowed any harm to befall\\r\\npoor young Mr. McFarlane.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s for a jury to decide,” said Lestrade. “Anyhow, we shall have you\\r\\non a charge of conspiracy, if not for attempted murder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you’ll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking\\r\\naccount of Mr. Cornelius,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man started, and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have to thank you for a good deal,” said he. “Perhaps I’ll pay my\\r\\ndebt some day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled indulgently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancy that, for some few years, you will find your time very fully\\r\\noccupied,” said he. “By the way, what was it you put into the wood-pile\\r\\nbesides your old trousers? A dead dog, or rabbits, or what? You won’t\\r\\ntell? Dear me, how very unkind of you! Well, well, I daresay that a\\r\\ncouple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred\\r\\nashes. If ever you write an account, Watson, you can make rabbits serve\\r\\nyour turn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE DANCING MEN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long,\\r\\nthin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a\\r\\nparticularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and\\r\\nhe looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull\\r\\ngray plumage and a black top-knot.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, Watson,” said he, suddenly, “you do not propose to invest in South\\r\\nAfrican securities?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes’s curious\\r\\nfaculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was\\r\\nutterly inexplicable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How on earth do you know that?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand,\\r\\nand a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly\\r\\nsimple.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see, my dear Watson,”--he propped his test-tube in the rack, and\\r\\nbegan to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class--“it\\r\\nis not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each\\r\\ndependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after\\r\\ndoing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents\\r\\none’s audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may\\r\\nproduce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was\\r\\nnot really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left\\r\\nforefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did NOT propose to invest\\r\\nyour small capital in the gold fields.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see no connection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here\\r\\nare the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between\\r\\nyour left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.\\r\\n2. You put chalk there when you play billiards, to steady the cue. 3.\\r\\nYou never play billiards except with Thurston. 4. You told me, four\\r\\nweeks ago, that Thurston had an option on some South African property\\r\\nwhich would expire in a month, and which he desired you to share with\\r\\nhim. 5. Your check book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked\\r\\nfor the key. 6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How absurdly simple!” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so!” said he, a little nettled. “Every problem becomes very\\r\\nchildish when once it is explained to you. Here is an unexplained one.\\r\\nSee what you can make of that, friend Watson.” He tossed a sheet of\\r\\npaper upon the table, and turned once more to his chemical analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\nI looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Holmes, it is a child’s drawing,” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s your idea!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What else should it be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is\\r\\nvery anxious to know. This little conundrum came by the first post, and\\r\\nhe was to follow by the next train. There’s a ring at the bell, Watson.\\r\\nI should not be very much surprised if this were he.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there\\r\\nentered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and\\r\\nflorid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker Street. He\\r\\nseemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air\\r\\nwith him as he entered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he was\\r\\nabout to sit down, when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious\\r\\nmarkings, which I had just examined and left upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?” he cried. “They told me\\r\\nthat you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don’t think you can find a\\r\\nqueerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead, so that you might have\\r\\ntime to study it before I came.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is certainly rather a curious production,” said Holmes. “At first\\r\\nsight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number\\r\\nof absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they\\r\\nare drawn. Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an\\r\\nobject?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is frightening her to\\r\\ndeath. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That’s why I\\r\\nwant to sift the matter to the bottom.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was\\r\\na page torn from a notebook. The markings were done in pencil, and ran\\r\\nin this way:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he\\r\\nplaced it in his pocketbook.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,” said he.\\r\\n“You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I\\r\\nshould be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for\\r\\nthe benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not much of a story-teller,” said our visitor, nervously clasping\\r\\nand unclasping his great, strong hands. “You’ll just ask me anything\\r\\nthat I don’t make clear. I’ll begin at the time of my marriage last\\r\\nyear, but I want to say first of all that, though I’m not a rich man,\\r\\nmy people have been at Riding Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and\\r\\nthere is no better known family in the County of Norfolk. Last year I\\r\\ncame up to London for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in\\r\\nRussell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in\\r\\nit. There was an American young lady there--Patrick was the name--Elsie\\r\\nPatrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was up\\r\\nI was as much in love as man could be. We were quietly married at a\\r\\nregistry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. You’ll\\r\\nthink it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should\\r\\nmarry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of\\r\\nher people, but if you saw her and knew her, it would help you to\\r\\nunderstand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can’t say that she did not\\r\\ngive me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. ‘I have\\r\\nhad some very disagreeable associations in my life,’ said she, ‘I wish\\r\\nto forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for\\r\\nit is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman\\r\\nwho has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of, but you will\\r\\nhave to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent\\r\\nas to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these\\r\\nconditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk, and leave me to the\\r\\nlonely life in which you found me.’ It was only the day before our\\r\\nwedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was\\r\\ncontent to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my\\r\\nword.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been.\\r\\nBut about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time\\r\\nsigns of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from America. I saw\\r\\nthe American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw\\r\\nit into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made\\r\\nnone, for a promise is a promise, but she has never known an easy hour\\r\\nfrom that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face--a look\\r\\nas if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me.\\r\\nShe would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks, I can\\r\\nsay nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever\\r\\ntrouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of\\r\\nhers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in\\r\\nEngland who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it\\r\\nwell, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring\\r\\nany stain upon it--of that I am sure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week ago--it\\r\\nwas the Tuesday of last week--I found on one of the window-sills a\\r\\nnumber of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper. They\\r\\nwere scrawled with chalk. I thought that it was the stable-boy who had\\r\\ndrawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. Anyhow, they had\\r\\ncome there during the night. I had them washed out, and I only mentioned\\r\\nthe matter to my wife afterwards. To my surprise, she took it very\\r\\nseriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did\\r\\ncome for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on\\r\\nthe sundial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped\\r\\nin a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half\\r\\ndazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. It was then that I\\r\\nwrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was not a thing that\\r\\nI could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you\\r\\nwill tell me what to do. I am not a rich man, but if there is any danger\\r\\nthreatening my little woman, I would spend my last copper to shield\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil--simple,\\r\\nstraight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad,\\r\\ncomely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his\\r\\nfeatures. Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention,\\r\\nand now he sat for some time in silent thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you think, Mr. Cubitt,” said he, at last, “that your best plan\\r\\nwould be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share\\r\\nher secret with you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHilton Cubitt shook his massive head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to tell me she\\r\\nwould. If not, it is not for me to force her confidence. But I am\\r\\njustified in taking my own line--and I will.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you\\r\\nheard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause\\r\\ncomment?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small\\r\\nwatering-places not very far away. And the farmers take in lodgers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely\\r\\narbitrary one, it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on the other\\r\\nhand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom\\r\\nof it. But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and\\r\\nthe facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no\\r\\nbasis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk,\\r\\nthat you keep a keen lookout, and that you take an exact copy of any\\r\\nfresh dancing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we\\r\\nhave not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the\\r\\nwindow-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the\\r\\nneighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence, come to me\\r\\nagain. That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt.\\r\\nIf there are any pressing fresh developments, I shall be always ready to\\r\\nrun down and see you in your Norfolk home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times in\\r\\nthe next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his notebook\\r\\nand look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. He\\r\\nmade no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight\\r\\nor so later. I was going out when he called me back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better stay here, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning. You remember\\r\\nHilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street at\\r\\none-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that\\r\\nthere have been some new incidents of importance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the\\r\\nstation as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and\\r\\ndepressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,” said he, as he\\r\\nsank, like a wearied man, into an armchair. “It’s bad enough to feel\\r\\nthat you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of\\r\\ndesign upon you, but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just\\r\\nkilling your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood\\r\\ncan endure. She’s wearing away under it--just wearing away before my\\r\\neyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Has she said anything yet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when the\\r\\npoor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself\\r\\nto take the plunge. I have tried to help her, but I daresay I did it\\r\\nclumsily, and scared her from it. She has spoken about my old family,\\r\\nand our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied honour,\\r\\nand I always felt it was leading to the point, but somehow it turned off\\r\\nbefore we got there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you have found out something for yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dancing-men pictures for\\r\\nyou to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, the man who draws them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order.\\r\\nWhen I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next\\r\\nmorning was a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn in chalk\\r\\nupon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the\\r\\nlawn in full view of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and here\\r\\nit is.” He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. Here is a copy\\r\\nof the hieroglyphics:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” said Holmes. “Excellent! Pray continue.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I had taken the copy, I rubbed out the marks, but, two mornings\\r\\nlater, a fresh inscription had appeared. I have a copy of it here:”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our material is rapidly accumulating,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed\\r\\nunder a pebble upon the sundial. Here it is. The characters are, as you\\r\\nsee, exactly the same as the last one. After that I determined to lie in\\r\\nwait, so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks\\r\\nthe lawn and garden. About two in the morning I was seated by the\\r\\nwindow, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard\\r\\nsteps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown. She\\r\\nimplored me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished to see who\\r\\nit was who played such absurd tricks upon us. She answered that it was\\r\\nsome senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I,\\r\\nand so avoid this nuisance.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?’ said I.\\r\\n‘Why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well, come to bed,’ said she, ‘and we can discuss it in the morning.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the\\r\\nmoonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something was moving\\r\\nin the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which\\r\\ncrawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my\\r\\npistol, I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held\\r\\nme with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to\\r\\nme most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened\\r\\nthe door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a\\r\\ntrace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same\\r\\narrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which\\r\\nI have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow\\r\\nanywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing\\r\\nis that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the\\r\\ndoor again in the morning, he had scrawled some more of his pictures\\r\\nunder the line which I had already seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you that fresh drawing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain he produced a paper. The new dance was in this form:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me,” said Holmes--and I could see by his eyes that he was much\\r\\nexcited--“was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be\\r\\nentirely separate?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was on a different panel of the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It\\r\\nfills me with hopes. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most\\r\\ninteresting statement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with\\r\\nmy wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the\\r\\nskulking rascal. She said that she feared that I might come to harm. For\\r\\nan instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared\\r\\nwas that HE might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who\\r\\nthis man was, and what he meant by these strange signals. But there is a\\r\\ntone in my wife’s voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid\\r\\ndoubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her\\r\\nmind. There’s the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I\\r\\nought to do. My own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads\\r\\nin the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a\\r\\nhiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“How long can you stay in London?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for\\r\\nanything. She is very nervous, and begged me to come back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I daresay you are right. But if you could have stopped, I might\\r\\npossibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile\\r\\nyou will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that\\r\\nI shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon\\r\\nyour case.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor\\r\\nhad left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see\\r\\nthat he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt’s broad\\r\\nback had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table,\\r\\nlaid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him,\\r\\nand threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For\\r\\ntwo hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with\\r\\nfigures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had\\r\\nevidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and\\r\\nwhistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit\\r\\nfor long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang\\r\\nfrom his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the\\r\\nroom rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a\\r\\ncable form. “If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very\\r\\npretty case to add to your collection, Watson,” said he. “I expect that\\r\\nwe shall be able to go down to Norfolk tomorrow, and to take our friend\\r\\nsome very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes\\r\\nliked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way, so I\\r\\nwaited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of\\r\\nimpatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every\\r\\nring of the bell. On the evening of the second there came a letter from\\r\\nHilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had\\r\\nappeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sundial. He inclosed a\\r\\ncopy of it, which is here reproduced:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then\\r\\nsuddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay.\\r\\nHis face was haggard with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have let this affair go far enough,” said he. “Is there a train to\\r\\nNorth Walsham to-night?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned up the time-table. The last had just gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,”\\r\\n said Holmes. “Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our\\r\\nexpected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson, there may be an answer. No,\\r\\nthat is quite as I expected. This message makes it even more essential\\r\\nthat we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how\\r\\nmatters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our\\r\\nsimple Norfolk squire is entangled.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story\\r\\nwhich had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre, I experience\\r\\nonce again the dismay and horror with which I was filled. Would that I\\r\\nhad some brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the\\r\\nchronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange\\r\\nchain of events which for some days made Riding Thorpe Manor a household\\r\\nword through the length and breadth of England.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and mentioned the name of our\\r\\ndestination, when the station-master hurried towards us. “I suppose that\\r\\nyou are the detectives from London?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nA look of annoyance passed over Holmes’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What makes you think such a thing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has just passed through. But\\r\\nmaybe you are the surgeons. She’s not dead--or wasn’t by last accounts.\\r\\nYou may be in time to save her yet--though it be for the gallows.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s brow was dark with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are going to Riding Thorpe Manor,” said he, “but we have heard\\r\\nnothing of what has passed there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a terrible business,” said the stationmaster. “They are shot, both\\r\\nMr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shot him and then herself--so the\\r\\nservants say. He’s dead and her life is despaired of. Dear, dear, one\\r\\nof the oldest families in the county of Norfolk, and one of the most\\r\\nhonoured.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven\\r\\nmiles’ drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so\\r\\nutterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our journey from\\r\\ntown, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with\\r\\nanxious attention, but now this sudden realization of his worst fears\\r\\nleft him in a blank melancholy. He leaned back in his seat, lost in\\r\\ngloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we\\r\\nwere passing through as singular a countryside as any in England, where\\r\\na few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on\\r\\nevery hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat\\r\\ngreen landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia.\\r\\nAt last the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over the green edge\\r\\nof the Norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old\\r\\nbrick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. “That’s\\r\\nRiding Thorpe Manor,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we drove up to the porticoed front door, I observed in front of it,\\r\\nbeside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled sundial\\r\\nwith which we had such strange associations. A dapper little man, with\\r\\na quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just descended from a\\r\\nhigh dog-cart. He introduced himself as Inspector Martin, of the Norfolk\\r\\nConstabulary, and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name\\r\\nof my companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning.\\r\\nHow could you hear of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you must have important evidence, of which we are ignorant, for\\r\\nthey were said to be a most united couple.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have only the evidence of the dancing men,” said Holmes. “I will\\r\\nexplain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to\\r\\nprevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge\\r\\nwhich I possess in order to insure that justice be done. Will you\\r\\nassociate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act\\r\\nindependently?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes,”\\r\\n said the inspector, earnestly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the\\r\\npremises without an instant of unnecessary delay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things\\r\\nin his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the\\r\\nresults. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down\\r\\nfrom Mrs. Hilton Cubitt’s room, and he reported that her injuries were\\r\\nserious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed through the\\r\\nfront of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could\\r\\nregain consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or\\r\\nhad shot herself, he would not venture to express any decided opinion.\\r\\nCertainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There\\r\\nwas only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had\\r\\nbeen emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was\\r\\nequally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that\\r\\nshe had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway\\r\\nbetween them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Has he been moved?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lying\\r\\nwounded upon the floor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long have you been here, Doctor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Since four o’clock.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyone else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the constable here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you have touched nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The housemaid, Saunders.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it she who gave the alarm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She and Mrs. King, the cook.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are they now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the kitchen, I believe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I think we had better hear their story at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a\\r\\ncourt of investigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his\\r\\ninexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. I could read in them\\r\\na set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he\\r\\nhad failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin,\\r\\nthe old, gray-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village\\r\\npoliceman made up the rest of that strange company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused\\r\\nfrom their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed\\r\\na minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs.\\r\\nKing had rushed in to Saunders. Together they had descended the stairs.\\r\\nThe door of the study was open, and a candle was burning upon the table.\\r\\nTheir master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. He was quite\\r\\ndead. Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against\\r\\nthe wall. She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red\\r\\nwith blood. She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything.\\r\\nThe passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of\\r\\npowder. The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both\\r\\nwomen were positive upon the point. They had at once sent for the\\r\\ndoctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the\\r\\nstable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. Both\\r\\nshe and her husband had occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress--he\\r\\nin his dressing-gown, over his night-clothes. Nothing had been moved in\\r\\nthe study. So far as they knew, there had never been any quarrel between\\r\\nhusband and wife. They had always looked upon them as a very united\\r\\ncouple.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese were the main points of the servants’ evidence. In answer to\\r\\nInspector Martin, they were clear that every door was fastened upon the\\r\\ninside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. In answer to\\r\\nHolmes, they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of\\r\\npowder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top\\r\\nfloor. “I commend that fact very carefully to your attention,” said\\r\\nHolmes to his professional colleague. “And now I think that we are in a\\r\\nposition to undertake a thorough examination of the room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books,\\r\\nand with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out\\r\\nupon the garden. Our first attention was given to the body of the\\r\\nunfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. His\\r\\ndisordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep.\\r\\nThe bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in\\r\\nhis body, after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly been\\r\\ninstantaneous and painless. There was no powder-marking either upon his\\r\\ndressing-gown or on his hands. According to the country surgeon, the\\r\\nlady had stains upon her face, but none upon her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may\\r\\nmean everything,” said Holmes. “Unless the powder from a badly fitting\\r\\ncartridge happens to spurt backward, one may fire many shots without\\r\\nleaving a sign. I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt’s body may now be\\r\\nremoved. I suppose, Doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which\\r\\nwounded the lady?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. But\\r\\nthere are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and\\r\\ntwo wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it would seem,” said Holmes. “Perhaps you can account also for the\\r\\nbullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole\\r\\nwhich had been drilled right through the lower window-sash, about an\\r\\ninch above the bottom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By George!” cried the inspector. “How ever did you see that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I looked for it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” said the country doctor. “You are certainly right, sir.\\r\\nThen a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have\\r\\nbeen present. But who could that have been, and how could he have got\\r\\naway?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is the problem which we are now about to solve,” said Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes. “You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on\\r\\nleaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder, I\\r\\nremarked that the point was an extremely important one?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It suggested that at the time of the firing, the window as well as the\\r\\ndoor of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not\\r\\nhave been blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was\\r\\nnecessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short\\r\\ntime, however.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you prove that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because the candle was not guttered.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Capital!” cried the inspector. “Capital!\\r\\n\\r\\n“Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy,\\r\\nI conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who\\r\\nstood outside this opening and fired through it. Any shot directed at\\r\\nthis person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was\\r\\nthe bullet mark!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But how came the window to be shut and fastened?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The woman’s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. But,\\r\\nhalloa! What is this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a lady’s hand-bag which stood upon the study table--a trim little\\r\\nhandbag of crocodile-skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned\\r\\nthe contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of\\r\\nEngland, held together by an india-rubber band--nothing else.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial,” said Holmes,\\r\\nas he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. “It is now\\r\\nnecessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet,\\r\\nwhich has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from\\r\\ninside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. You\\r\\nsaid, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a LOUD explosion. When you\\r\\nsaid that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the\\r\\nsecond one?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, so it is hard to judge. But it\\r\\ndid seem very loud.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the\\r\\nsame instant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure I couldn’t say, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin,\\r\\nthat we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will\\r\\nkindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden\\r\\nhas to offer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an\\r\\nexclamation as we approached it. The flowers were trampled down, and the\\r\\nsoft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Large, masculine feet\\r\\nthey were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among\\r\\nthe grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with\\r\\na cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen\\r\\ncylinder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought so,” said he, “the revolver had an ejector, and here is the\\r\\nthird cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is\\r\\nalmost complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe country inspector’s face had shown his intense amazement at the\\r\\nrapid and masterful progress of Holmes’s investigation. At first he\\r\\nhad shown some disposition to assert his own position, but now he was\\r\\novercome with admiration, and ready to follow without question wherever\\r\\nHolmes led.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom do you suspect?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll go into that later. There are several points in this problem which\\r\\nI have not been able to explain to you yet. Now that I have got so far,\\r\\nI had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up\\r\\nonce and for all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment\\r\\nof action to enter into long and complex explanations. I have the\\r\\nthreads of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady should never\\r\\nrecover consciousness, we can still reconstruct the events of last night\\r\\nand insure that justice be done. First of all, I wish to know whether\\r\\nthere is any inn in this neighbourhood known as ‘Elrige’s’?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a\\r\\nplace. The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that\\r\\na farmer of that name lived some miles off, in the direction of East\\r\\nRuston.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it a lonely farm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very lonely, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the\\r\\nnight?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe not, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes thought for a little, and then a curious smile played over his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Saddle a horse, my lad,” said he. “I shall wish you to take a note to\\r\\nElrige’s Farm.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these\\r\\nin front of him, he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he\\r\\nhanded a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands\\r\\nof the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no\\r\\nquestions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of\\r\\nthe note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike\\r\\nHolmes’s usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney, Elriges\\r\\nFarm, East Ruston, Norfolk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, Inspector,” Holmes remarked, “that you would do well to\\r\\ntelegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you\\r\\nmay have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail.\\r\\nThe boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If\\r\\nthere is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well\\r\\nto take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish,\\r\\nand this investigation draws rapidly to a close.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave\\r\\nhis instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to call asking for\\r\\nMrs. Hilton Cubitt, no information should be given as to her condition,\\r\\nbut he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these\\r\\npoints upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way\\r\\ninto the drawing-room, with the remark that the business was now out of\\r\\nour hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until\\r\\nwe could see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his\\r\\npatients, and only the inspector and myself remained.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and\\r\\nprofitable manner,” said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table,\\r\\nand spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were\\r\\nrecorded the antics of the dancing men. “As to you, friend Watson, I owe\\r\\nyou every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain\\r\\nso long unsatisfied. To you, Inspector, the whole incident may appeal\\r\\nas a remarkable professional study. I must tell you, first of all, the\\r\\ninteresting circumstances connected with the previous consultations\\r\\nwhich Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker Street.” He then\\r\\nshortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. “I\\r\\nhave here in front of me these singular productions, at which one\\r\\nmight smile, had they not proved themselves to be the forerunners of\\r\\nso terrible a tragedy. I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret\\r\\nwritings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the\\r\\nsubject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers,\\r\\nbut I confess that this is entirely new to me. The object of those who\\r\\ninvented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters\\r\\nconvey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random\\r\\nsketches of children.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Having once recognized, however, that the symbols stood for letters,\\r\\nand having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret\\r\\nwritings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted to\\r\\nme was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say,\\r\\nwith some confidence, that the symbol XXX stood for E. As you are aware,\\r\\nE is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates\\r\\nto so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect\\r\\nto find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message, four\\r\\nwere the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E. It is true\\r\\nthat in some cases the figure was bearing a flag, and in some cases not,\\r\\nbut it was probable, from the way in which the flags were distributed,\\r\\nthat they were used to break the sentence up into words. I accepted this\\r\\nas a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by XXX.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of\\r\\nthe English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any\\r\\npreponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be\\r\\nreversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S,\\r\\nH, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur, but T,\\r\\nA, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an\\r\\nendless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at.\\r\\nI therefore waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr.\\r\\nHilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one\\r\\nmessage, which appeared--since there was no flag--to be a single word.\\r\\nHere are the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the\\r\\ntwo E’s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might\\r\\nbe ‘sever,’ or ‘lever,’ or ‘never.’ There can be no question that\\r\\nthe latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and\\r\\nthe circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady.\\r\\nAccepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols stand\\r\\nrespectively for N, V, and R.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me\\r\\nin possession of several other letters. It occurred to me that if these\\r\\nappeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the\\r\\nlady in her early life, a combination which contained two E’s with\\r\\nthree letters between might very well stand for the name ‘ELSIE.’ On\\r\\nexamination I found that such a combination formed the termination of\\r\\nthe message which was three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal\\r\\nto ‘Elsie.’ In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could\\r\\nit be? There were only four letters in the word which preceded ‘Elsie,’\\r\\nand it ended in E. Surely the word must be ‘COME.’ I tried all other\\r\\nfour letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case. So now I\\r\\nwas in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the\\r\\nfirst message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for\\r\\neach symbol which was still unknown. So treated, it worked out in this\\r\\nfashion:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n.M .ERE ..E SL.NE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now the first letter CAN only be A, which is a most useful discovery,\\r\\nsince it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and\\r\\nthe H is also apparent in the second word. Now it becomes:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAM HERE A.E SLANE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOr, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAM HERE ABE SLANEY.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable\\r\\nconfidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA. ELRI. ES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters,\\r\\nand supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the\\r\\nwriter was staying.”\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full\\r\\nand clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to\\r\\nso complete a command over our difficulties.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you do then, sir?” asked the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American,\\r\\nsince Abe is an American contraction, and since a letter from America\\r\\nhad been the starting-point of all the trouble. I had also every cause\\r\\nto think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. The lady’s\\r\\nallusions to her past, and her refusal to take her husband into her\\r\\nconfidence, both pointed in that direction. I therefore cabled to my\\r\\nfriend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New York Police Bureau, who has more\\r\\nthan once made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether\\r\\nthe name of Abe Slaney was known to him. Here is his reply: ‘The most\\r\\ndangerous crook in Chicago.’ On the very evening upon which I had his\\r\\nanswer, Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney. Working with\\r\\nknown letters, it took this form:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nELSIE .RE.ARE TO MEET THY GO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the\\r\\nrascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of\\r\\nthe crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly\\r\\nput his words into action. I at once came to Norfolk with my friend and\\r\\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the\\r\\nworst had already occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,”\\r\\n said the inspector, warmly. “You will excuse me, however, if I speak\\r\\nfrankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to\\r\\nanswer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige’s, is\\r\\nindeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated\\r\\nhere, I should certainly get into serious trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You need not be uneasy. He will not try to escape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To fly would be a confession of guilt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then let us go arrest him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I expect him here every instant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why should he come.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I have written and asked him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes! Why should he come because you\\r\\nhave asked him? Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and\\r\\ncause him to fly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I have known how to frame the letter,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n“In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself\\r\\ncoming up the drive.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA man was striding up the path which led to the door. He was a tall,\\r\\nhandsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of gray flannel, with a Panama\\r\\nhat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and\\r\\nflourishing a cane as he walked. He swaggered up a path as if as if\\r\\nthe place belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the\\r\\nbell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, gentlemen,” said Holmes, quietly, “that we had best take up\\r\\nour position behind the door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing\\r\\nwith such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, Inspector. You can\\r\\nleave the talking to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe waited in silence for a minute--one of those minutes which one can\\r\\nnever forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant\\r\\nHolmes clapped a pistol to his head, and Martin slipped the handcuffs\\r\\nover his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow\\r\\nwas helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to\\r\\nthe other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a\\r\\nbitter laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. I seem to have\\r\\nknocked up against something hard. But I came here in answer to a letter\\r\\nfrom Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don’t tell me that she is in this? Don’t tell\\r\\nme that she helped to set a trap for me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured, and is at death’s door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man gave a hoarse cry of grief, which rang through the house.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re crazy!” he cried, fiercely. “It was he that was hurt, not she.\\r\\nWho would have hurt little Elsie? I may have threatened her--God forgive\\r\\nme!--but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. Take it\\r\\nback--you! Say that she is not hurt!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was found badly wounded, by the side of her dead husband.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in his\\r\\nmanacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face\\r\\nonce more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,” said he. “If I shot the\\r\\nman he had his shot at me, and there’s no murder in that. But if you\\r\\nthink I could have hurt that woman, then you don’t know either me or\\r\\nher. I tell you, there was never a man in this world loved a woman more\\r\\nthan I loved her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to me years ago.\\r\\nWho was this Englishman that he should come between us? I tell you that\\r\\nI had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you\\r\\nare,” said Holmes, sternly. “She fled from America to avoid you, and she\\r\\nmarried an honourable gentleman in England. You dogged her and followed\\r\\nher and made her life a misery to her, in order to induce her to abandon\\r\\nthe husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom\\r\\nshe feared and hated. You have ended by bringing about the death of a\\r\\nnoble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this\\r\\nbusiness, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If Elsie dies, I care nothing what becomes of me,” said the American.\\r\\nHe opened one of his hands, and looked at a note crumpled up in his\\r\\npalm. “See here, mister! he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his\\r\\neyes, “you’re not trying to scare me over this, are you? If the lady is\\r\\nhurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?” He tossed it\\r\\nforward on to the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wrote it, to bring you here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wrote it? There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the\\r\\nsecret of the dancing men. How came you to write it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What one man can invent another can discover,” said Holmes. There is a\\r\\ncab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But meanwhile, you have\\r\\ntime to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought. Are\\r\\nyou aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion\\r\\nof the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence here, and\\r\\nthe knowledge which I happened to possess, which has saved her from the\\r\\naccusation? The least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole\\r\\nworld that she was in no way, directly or indirectly, responsible for\\r\\nhis tragic end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I ask nothing better,” said the American. “I guess the very best case I\\r\\ncan make for myself is the absolute naked truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,” cried the\\r\\ninspector, with the magnificent fair play of the British criminal law.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlaney shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll chance that,” said he. “First of all, I want you gentlemen to\\r\\nunderstand that I have known this lady since she was a child. There were\\r\\nseven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie’s father was the boss of the\\r\\nJoint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that\\r\\nwriting, which would pass as a child’s scrawl unless you just happened\\r\\nto have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways, but she\\r\\ncouldn’t stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her\\r\\nown, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London. She had been\\r\\nengaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken\\r\\nover another profession, but she would have nothing to do with anything\\r\\non the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I\\r\\nwas able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer.\\r\\nAfter that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages\\r\\nwhere she could read them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where I had\\r\\na room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the\\r\\nwiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew that she read the\\r\\nmessages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. Then my temper\\r\\ngot the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She sent me a letter\\r\\nthen, imploring me to go away, and saying that it would break her heart\\r\\nif any scandal should come upon her husband. She said that she would\\r\\ncome down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak\\r\\nwith me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave\\r\\nher in peace. She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe\\r\\nme to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull\\r\\nher through the window. At that moment in rushed the husband with his\\r\\nrevolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were\\r\\nface to face. I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off\\r\\nand let me get away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the\\r\\nsame instant, and down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as\\r\\nI went I heard the window shut behind me. That’s God’s truth, gentlemen,\\r\\nevery word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came\\r\\nriding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give\\r\\nmyself into your hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two uniformed\\r\\npolicemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on\\r\\nthe shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is time for us to go.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I see her first?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever\\r\\nagain I have an important case, I shall have the good fortune to have\\r\\nyou by my side.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I turned back,\\r\\nmy eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the\\r\\ntable. It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See if you can read it, Watson,” said he, with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you use the code which I have explained,” said Holmes, “you will\\r\\nfind that it simply means ‘Come here at once.’ I was convinced that\\r\\nit was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never\\r\\nimagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear\\r\\nWatson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have\\r\\nso often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my\\r\\npromise of giving you something unusual for your notebook. Three-forty\\r\\nis our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was condemned to\\r\\ndeath at the winter assizes at Norwich, but his penalty was changed to\\r\\npenal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the\\r\\ncertainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton\\r\\nCubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that\\r\\nshe still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the\\r\\npoor and to the administration of her husband’s estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SOLITARY CYCLIST\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the years 1894 to 1901 inclusive, Mr. Sherlock Holmes was a\\r\\nvery busy man. It is safe to say that there was no public case of any\\r\\ndifficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years, and\\r\\nthere were hundreds of private cases, some of them of the most intricate\\r\\nand extraordinary character, in which he played a prominent part. Many\\r\\nstartling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of\\r\\nthis long period of continuous work. As I have preserved very full notes\\r\\nof all these cases, and was myself personally engaged in many of them,\\r\\nit may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which I should select\\r\\nto lay before the public. I shall, however, preserve my former rule, and\\r\\ngive the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so\\r\\nmuch from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic\\r\\nquality of the solution. For this reason I will now lay before the\\r\\nreader the facts connected with Miss Violet Smith, the solitary cyclist\\r\\nof Charlington, and the curious sequel of our investigation, which\\r\\nculminated in unexpected tragedy. It is true that the circumstance did\\r\\nnot admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my\\r\\nfriend was famous, but there were some points about the case which made\\r\\nit stand out in those long records of crime from which I gather the\\r\\nmaterial for these little narratives.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn referring to my notebook for the year 1895, I find that it was upon\\r\\nSaturday, the 23rd of April, that we first heard of Miss Violet Smith.\\r\\nHer visit was, I remember, extremely unwelcome to Holmes, for he was\\r\\nimmersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem\\r\\nconcerning the peculiar persecution to which John Vincent Harden, the\\r\\nwell known tobacco millionaire, had been subjected. My friend, who\\r\\nloved above all things precision and concentration of thought, resented\\r\\nanything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand.\\r\\nAnd yet, without a harshness which was foreign to his nature, it was\\r\\nimpossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful\\r\\nwoman, tall, graceful, and queenly, who presented herself at Baker\\r\\nStreet late in the evening, and implored his assistance and advice. It\\r\\nwas vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied, for the\\r\\nyoung lady had come with the determination to tell her story, and it was\\r\\nevident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until\\r\\nshe had done so. With a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile, Holmes\\r\\nbegged the beautiful intruder to take a seat, and to inform us what it\\r\\nwas that was troubling her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At least it cannot be your health,” said he, as his keen eyes darted\\r\\nover her, “so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe glanced down in surprise at her own feet, and I observed the slight\\r\\nroughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of\\r\\nthe pedal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I bicycle a good deal, Mr. Holmes, and that has something to do\\r\\nwith my visit to you to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend took the lady’s ungloved hand, and examined it with as close\\r\\nan attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a\\r\\nspecimen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will excuse me, I am sure. It is my business,” said he, as he\\r\\ndropped it. “I nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were\\r\\ntypewriting. Of course, it is obvious that it is music. You observe\\r\\nthe spatulate finger-ends, Watson, which is common to both professions?\\r\\nThere is a spirituality about the face, however”--she gently turned it\\r\\ntowards the light--“which the typewriter does not generate. This lady is\\r\\na musician.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes, I teach music.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the country, I presume, from your complexion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, near Farnham, on the borders of Surrey.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A beautiful neighbourhood, and full of the most interesting\\r\\nassociations. You remember, Watson, that it was near there that we took\\r\\nArchie Stamford, the forger. Now, Miss Violet, what has happened to you,\\r\\nnear Farnham, on the borders of Surrey?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young lady, with great clearness and composure, made the following\\r\\ncurious statement:\\r\\n\\r\\n“My father is dead, Mr. Holmes. He was James Smith, who conducted the\\r\\norchestra at the old Imperial Theatre. My mother and I were left without\\r\\na relation in the world except one uncle, Ralph Smith, who went to\\r\\nAfrica twenty-five years ago, and we have never had a word from him\\r\\nsince. When father died, we were left very poor, but one day we were\\r\\ntold that there was an advertisement in the TIMES, inquiring for our\\r\\nwhereabouts. You can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that\\r\\nsomeone had left us a fortune. We went at once to the lawyer whose name\\r\\nwas given in the paper. There we met two gentlemen, Mr. Carruthers and\\r\\nMr. Woodley, who were home on a visit from South Africa. They said that\\r\\nmy uncle was a friend of theirs, that he had died some months before in\\r\\ngreat poverty in Johannesburg, and that he had asked them with his last\\r\\nbreath to hunt up his relations, and see that they were in no want. It\\r\\nseemed strange to us that Uncle Ralph, who took no notice of us when he\\r\\nwas alive, should be so careful to look after us when he was dead, but\\r\\nMr. Carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just\\r\\nheard of the death of his brother, and so felt responsible for our\\r\\nfate.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me,” said Holmes. “When was this interview?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Last December--four months ago.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray proceed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person. He was for ever\\r\\nmaking eyes at me--a coarse, puffy-faced, red-moustached young man, with\\r\\nhis hair plastered down on each side of his forehead. I thought that he\\r\\nwas perfectly hateful--and I was sure that Cyril would not wish me to\\r\\nknow such a person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Cyril is his name!” said Holmes, smiling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young lady blushed and laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes, Cyril Morton, an electrical engineer, and we hope\\r\\nto be married at the end of the summer. Dear me, how DID I get talking\\r\\nabout him? What I wished to say was that Mr. Woodley was perfectly\\r\\nodious, but that Mr. Carruthers, who was a much older man, was more\\r\\nagreeable. He was a dark, sallow, clean-shaven, silent person, but he\\r\\nhad polite manners and a pleasant smile. He inquired how we were left,\\r\\nand on finding that we were very poor, he suggested that I should come\\r\\nand teach music to his only daughter, aged ten. I said that I did not\\r\\nlike to leave my mother, on which he suggested that I should go home\\r\\nto her every week-end, and he offered me a hundred a year, which was\\r\\ncertainly splendid pay. So it ended by my accepting, and I went down\\r\\nto Chiltern Grange, about six miles from Farnham. Mr. Carruthers was\\r\\na widower, but he had engaged a lady housekeeper, a very respectable,\\r\\nelderly person, called Mrs. Dixon, to look after his establishment. The\\r\\nchild was a dear, and everything promised well. Mr. Carruthers was very\\r\\nkind and very musical, and we had most pleasant evenings together. Every\\r\\nweek-end I went home to my mother in town.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red-moustached\\r\\nMr. Woodley. He came for a visit of a week, and oh! it seemed three\\r\\nmonths to me. He was a dreadful person--a bully to everyone else, but to\\r\\nme something infinitely worse. He made odious love to me, boasted of his\\r\\nwealth, said that if I married him I could have the finest diamonds in\\r\\nLondon, and finally, when I would have nothing to do with him, he seized\\r\\nme in his arms one day after dinner--he was hideously strong--and swore\\r\\nthat he would not let me go until I had kissed him. Mr. Carruthers came\\r\\nin and tore him from me, on which he turned upon his own host, knocking\\r\\nhim down and cutting his face open. That was the end of his visit, as\\r\\nyou can imagine. Mr. Carruthers apologized to me next day, and assured\\r\\nme that I should never be exposed to such an insult again. I have not\\r\\nseen Mr. Woodley since.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now, Mr. Holmes, I come at last to the special thing which has\\r\\ncaused me to ask your advice to-day. You must know that every Saturday\\r\\nforenoon I ride on my bicycle to Farnham Station, in order to get the\\r\\n12:22 to town. The road from Chiltern Grange is a lonely one, and at\\r\\none spot it is particularly so, for it lies for over a mile between\\r\\nCharlington Heath upon one side and the woods which lie round\\r\\nCharlington Hall upon the other. You could not find a more lonely tract\\r\\nof road anywhere, and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart, or a\\r\\npeasant, until you reach the high road near Crooksbury Hill. Two weeks\\r\\nago I was passing this place, when I chanced to look back over my\\r\\nshoulder, and about two hundred yards behind me I saw a man, also on a\\r\\nbicycle. He seemed to be a middle-aged man, with a short, dark beard. I\\r\\nlooked back before I reached Farnham, but the man was gone, so I thought\\r\\nno more about it. But you can imagine how surprised I was, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nwhen, on my return on the Monday, I saw the same man on the same stretch\\r\\nof road. My astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again,\\r\\nexactly as before, on the following Saturday and Monday. He always kept\\r\\nhis distance and did not molest me in any way, but still it certainly\\r\\nwas very odd. I mentioned it to Mr. Carruthers, who seemed interested in\\r\\nwhat I said, and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap, so\\r\\nthat in future I should not pass over these lonely roads without some\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The horse and trap were to have come this week, but for some reason\\r\\nthey were not delivered, and again I had to cycle to the station.\\r\\nThat was this morning. You can think that I looked out when I came to\\r\\nCharlington Heath, and there, sure enough, was the man, exactly as he\\r\\nhad been the two weeks before. He always kept so far from me that I\\r\\ncould not clearly see his face, but it was certainly someone whom I did\\r\\nnot know. He was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap. The only thing\\r\\nabout his face that I could clearly see was his dark beard. To-day I was\\r\\nnot alarmed, but I was filled with curiosity, and I determined to find\\r\\nout who he was and what he wanted. I slowed down my machine, but he\\r\\nslowed down his. Then I stopped altogether, but he stopped also. Then\\r\\nI laid a trap for him. There is a sharp turning of the road, and I\\r\\npedalled very quickly round this, and then I stopped and waited. I\\r\\nexpected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop. But he\\r\\nnever appeared. Then I went back and looked round the corner. I\\r\\ncould see a mile of road, but he was not on it. To make it the more\\r\\nextraordinary, there was no side road at this point down which he could\\r\\nhave gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. “This case certainly presents\\r\\nsome features of its own,” said he. “How much time elapsed between your\\r\\nturning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two or three minutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he could not have retreated down the road, and you say that there\\r\\nare no side roads?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It could not have been on the side of the heath, or I should have seen\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, by the process of exclusion, we arrive at the fact that he made his\\r\\nway toward Charlington Hall, which, as I understand, is situated in its\\r\\nown grounds on one side of the road. Anything else?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, Mr. Holmes, save that I was so perplexed that I felt I should\\r\\nnot be happy until I had seen you and had your advice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat in silence for some little time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged?” he asked at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is in the Midland Electrical Company, at Coventry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He would not pay you a surprise visit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Mr. Holmes! As if I should not know him!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you had any other admirers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Several before I knew Cyril.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And since?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was this dreadful man, Woodley, if you can call him an admirer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one else?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur fair client seemed a little confused.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who was he?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine; but it had seemed to me sometimes\\r\\nthat my employer, Mr. Carruthers, takes a great deal of interest in me.\\r\\nWe are thrown rather together. I play his accompaniments in the evening.\\r\\nHe has never said anything. He is a perfect gentleman. But a girl always\\r\\nknows.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” Holmes looked grave. “What does he do for a living?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is a rich man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No carriages or horses?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, at least he is fairly well-to-do. But he goes into the city two\\r\\nor three times a week. He is deeply interested in South African gold\\r\\nshares.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will let me know any fresh development, Miss Smith. I am very busy\\r\\njust now, but I will find time to make some inquiries into your case.\\r\\nIn the meantime, take no step without letting me know. Good-bye, and I\\r\\ntrust that we shall have nothing but good news from you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is part of the settled order of Nature that such a girl should have\\r\\nfollowers,” said Holmes, he pulled at his meditative pipe, “but for\\r\\nchoice not on bicycles in lonely country roads. Some secretive lover,\\r\\nbeyond all doubt. But there are curious and suggestive details about the\\r\\ncase, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That he should appear only at that point?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. Our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of\\r\\nCharlington Hall. Then, again, how about the connection between\\r\\nCarruthers and Woodley, since they appear to be men of such a different\\r\\ntype? How came they BOTH to be so keen upon looking up Ralph Smith’s\\r\\nrelations? One more point. What sort of a menage is it which pays double\\r\\nthe market price for a governess but does not keep a horse, although six\\r\\nmiles from the station? Odd, Watson--very odd!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will go down?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, my dear fellow, YOU will go down. This may be some trifling\\r\\nintrigue, and I cannot break my other important research for the sake\\r\\nof it. On Monday you will arrive early at Farnham; you will conceal\\r\\nyourself near Charlington Heath; you will observe these facts for\\r\\nyourself, and act as your own judgment advises. Then, having inquired as\\r\\nto the occupants of the Hall, you will come back to me and report. And\\r\\nnow, Watson, not another word of the matter until we have a few solid\\r\\nstepping-stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by\\r\\nthe train which leaves Waterloo at 9:50, so I started early and caught\\r\\nthe 9:13. At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in being directed to\\r\\nCharlington Heath. It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young\\r\\nlady’s adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side\\r\\nand an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded\\r\\nwith magnificent trees. There was a main gateway of lichen-studded\\r\\nstone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems, but\\r\\nbesides this central carriage drive I observed several points where\\r\\nthere were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. The house\\r\\nwas invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and\\r\\ndecay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming\\r\\nmagnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one of\\r\\nthese clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway\\r\\nof the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. It had been\\r\\ndeserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the\\r\\nopposite direction to that in which I had come. He was clad in a dark\\r\\nsuit, and I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the\\r\\nCharlington grounds, he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap\\r\\nin the hedge, disappearing from my view.\\r\\n\\r\\nA quarter of an hour passed, and then a second cyclist appeared. This\\r\\ntime it was the young lady coming from the station. I saw her look\\r\\nabout her as she came to the Charlington hedge. An instant later the man\\r\\nemerged from his hiding-place, sprang upon his cycle, and followed\\r\\nher. In all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures, the\\r\\ngraceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine, and the man behind\\r\\nher bending low over his handle-bar with a curiously furtive suggestion\\r\\nin every movement. She looked back at him and slowed her pace. He slowed\\r\\nalso. She stopped. He at once stopped, too, keeping two hundred yards\\r\\nbehind her. Her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited. She\\r\\nsuddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him. He was as\\r\\nquick as she, however, and darted off in desperate flight. Presently she\\r\\ncame back up the road again, her head haughtily in the air, not deigning\\r\\nto take any further notice of her silent attendant. He had turned also,\\r\\nand still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\nI remained in my hiding-place, and it was well that I did so, for\\r\\npresently the man reappeared, cycling slowly back. He turned in at the\\r\\nHall gates, and dismounted from his machine. For some minutes I could\\r\\nsee him standing among the trees. His hands were raised, and he seemed\\r\\nto be settling his necktie. Then he mounted his cycle, and rode away\\r\\nfrom me down the drive towards the Hall. I ran across the heath and\\r\\npeered through the trees. Far away I could catch glimpses of the old\\r\\ngray building with its bristling Tudor chimneys, but the drive ran\\r\\nthrough a dense shrubbery, and I saw no more of my man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it seemed to me that I had done a fairly good morning’s work,\\r\\nand I walked back in high spirits to Farnham. The local house agent\\r\\ncould tell me nothing about Charlington Hall, and referred me to a well\\r\\nknown firm in Pall Mall. There I halted on my way home, and met with\\r\\ncourtesy from the representative. No, I could not have Charlington Hall\\r\\nfor the summer. I was just too late. It had been let about a month ago.\\r\\nMr. Williamson was the name of the tenant. He was a respectable, elderly\\r\\ngentleman. The polite agent was afraid he could say no more, as the\\r\\naffairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes listened with attention to the long report which I\\r\\nwas able to present to him that evening, but it did not elicit that\\r\\nword of curt praise which I had hoped for and should have valued. On\\r\\nthe contrary, his austere face was even more severe than usual as he\\r\\ncommented upon the things that I had done and the things that I had not.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your hiding-place, my dear Watson, was very faulty. You should have\\r\\nbeen behind the hedge, then you would have had a close view of this\\r\\ninteresting person. As it is, you were some hundreds of yards away and\\r\\ncan tell me even less than Miss Smith. She thinks she does not know\\r\\nthe man; I am convinced she does. Why, otherwise, should he be so\\r\\ndesperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his\\r\\nfeatures? You describe him as bending over the handle-bar. Concealment\\r\\nagain, you see. You really have done remarkably badly. He returns to the\\r\\nhouse, and you want to find out who he is. You come to a London house\\r\\nagent!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What should I have done?” I cried, with some heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gone to the nearest public-house. That is the centre of country\\r\\ngossip. They would have told you every name, from the master to the\\r\\nscullery-maid. Williamson? It conveys nothing to my mind. If he is an\\r\\nelderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that\\r\\nyoung lady’s athletic pursuit. What have we gained by your expedition?\\r\\nThe knowledge that the girl’s story is true. I never doubted it. That\\r\\nthere is a connection between the cyclist and the Hall. I never doubted\\r\\nthat either. That the Hall is tenanted by Williamson. Who’s the better\\r\\nfor that? Well, well, my dear sir, don’t look so depressed. We can do\\r\\nlittle more until next Saturday, and in the meantime I may make one or\\r\\ntwo inquiries myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, we had a note from Miss Smith, recounting shortly and\\r\\naccurately the very incidents which I had seen, but the pith of the\\r\\nletter lay in the postscript:\\r\\n\\r\\nI am sure that you will respect my confidence, Mr. Holmes, when I tell\\r\\nyou that my place here has become difficult, owing to the fact that my\\r\\nemployer has proposed marriage to me. I am convinced that his feelings\\r\\nare most deep and most honourable. At the same time, my promise is of\\r\\ncourse given. He took my refusal very seriously, but also very gently.\\r\\nYou can understand, however, that the situation is a little strained.\\r\\n“Our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters,” said Holmes,\\r\\nthoughtfully, as he finished the letter. “The case certainly presents\\r\\nmore features of interest and more possibility of development than I had\\r\\noriginally thought. I should be none the worse for a quiet, peaceful day\\r\\nin the country, and I am inclined to run down this afternoon and test\\r\\none or two theories which I have formed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s quiet day in the country had a singular termination, for\\r\\nhe arrived at Baker Street late in the evening, with a cut lip and a\\r\\ndiscoloured lump upon his forehead, besides a general air of dissipation\\r\\nwhich would have made his own person the fitting object of a Scotland\\r\\nYard investigation. He was immensely tickled by his own adventures and\\r\\nlaughed heartily as he recounted them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I get so little active exercise that it is always a treat,” said he.\\r\\n“You are aware that I have some proficiency in the good old British\\r\\nsport of boxing. Occasionally, it is of service, to-day, for example, I\\r\\nshould have come to very ignominious grief without it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI begged him to tell me what had occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I found that country pub which I had already recommended to your\\r\\nnotice, and there I made my discreet inquiries. I was in the bar, and\\r\\na garrulous landlord was giving me all that I wanted. Williamson is a\\r\\nwhite-bearded man, and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at\\r\\nthe Hall. There is some rumor that he is or has been a clergyman, but\\r\\none or two incidents of his short residence at the Hall struck me as\\r\\npeculiarly unecclesiastical. I have already made some inquiries at a\\r\\nclerical agency, and they tell me that there WAS a man of that name\\r\\nin orders, whose career has been a singularly dark one. The landlord\\r\\nfurther informed me that there are usually week-end visitors--‘a\\r\\nwarm lot, sir’--at the Hall, and especially one gentleman with a red\\r\\nmoustache, Mr. Woodley by name, who was always there. We had got as far\\r\\nas this, when who should walk in but the gentleman himself, who had been\\r\\ndrinking his beer in the tap-room and had heard the whole conversation.\\r\\nWho was I? What did I want? What did I mean by asking questions? He had\\r\\na fine flow of language, and his adjectives were very vigorous. He ended\\r\\na string of abuse by a vicious backhander, which I failed to entirely\\r\\navoid. The next few minutes were delicious. It was a straight left\\r\\nagainst a slogging ruffian. I emerged as you see me. Mr. Woodley went\\r\\nhome in a cart. So ended my country trip, and it must be confessed that,\\r\\nhowever enjoyable, my day on the Surrey border has not been much more\\r\\nprofitable than your own.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Thursday brought us another letter from our client.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will not be surprised, Mr. Holmes [said she] to hear that I am\\r\\nleaving Mr. Carruthers’s employment. Even the high pay cannot reconcile\\r\\nme to the discomforts of my situation. On Saturday I come up to town,\\r\\nand I do not intend to return. Mr. Carruthers has got a trap, and so\\r\\nthe dangers of the lonely road, if there ever were any dangers, are now\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the special cause of my leaving, it is not merely the strained\\r\\nsituation with Mr. Carruthers, but it is the reappearance of that odious\\r\\nman, Mr. Woodley. He was always hideous, but he looks more awful\\r\\nthan ever now, for he appears to have had an accident and he is much\\r\\ndisfigured. I saw him out of the window, but I am glad to say I did\\r\\nnot meet him. He had a long talk with Mr. Carruthers, who seemed much\\r\\nexcited afterwards. Woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood, for\\r\\nhe did not sleep here, and yet I caught a glimpse of him again this\\r\\nmorning, slinking about in the shrubbery. I would sooner have a savage\\r\\nwild animal loose about the place. I loathe and fear him more than I\\r\\ncan say. How CAN Mr. Carruthers endure such a creature for a moment?\\r\\nHowever, all my troubles will be over on Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I trust, Watson, so I trust,” said Holmes, gravely. “There is some\\r\\ndeep intrigue going on round that little woman, and it is our duty to\\r\\nsee that no one molests her upon that last journey. I think, Watson,\\r\\nthat we must spare time to run down together on Saturday morning and\\r\\nmake sure that this curious and inclusive investigation has no untoward\\r\\nending.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess that I had not up to now taken a very serious view of\\r\\nthe case, which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than\\r\\ndangerous. That a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome\\r\\nwoman is no unheard-of thing, and if he has so little audacity that he\\r\\nnot only dared not address her, but even fled from her approach, he\\r\\nwas not a very formidable assailant. The ruffian Woodley was a very\\r\\ndifferent person, but, except on one occasion, he had not molested our\\r\\nclient, and now he visited the house of Carruthers without intruding\\r\\nupon her presence. The man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of\\r\\nthose week-end parties at the Hall of which the publican had spoken,\\r\\nbut who he was, or what he wanted, was as obscure as ever. It was the\\r\\nseverity of Holmes’s manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into\\r\\nhis pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling\\r\\nthat tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning, and the\\r\\nheath-covered countryside, with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse,\\r\\nseemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and\\r\\ndrabs and slate grays of London. Holmes and I walked along the broad,\\r\\nsandy road inhaling the fresh morning air and rejoicing in the music of\\r\\nthe birds and the fresh breath of the spring. From a rise of the road\\r\\non the shoulder of Crooksbury Hill, we could see the grim Hall bristling\\r\\nout from amidst the ancient oaks, which, old as they were, were still\\r\\nyounger than the building which they surrounded. Holmes pointed down the\\r\\nlong tract of road which wound, a reddish yellow band, between the brown\\r\\nof the heath and the budding green of the woods. Far away, a black\\r\\ndot, we could see a vehicle moving in our direction. Holmes gave an\\r\\nexclamation of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have given a margin of half an hour,” said he. “If that is her trap,\\r\\nshe must be making for the earlier train. I fear, Watson, that she will\\r\\nbe past Charlington before we can possibly meet her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the instant that we passed the rise, we could no longer see the\\r\\nvehicle, but we hastened onward at such a pace that my sedentary life\\r\\nbegan to tell upon me, and I was compelled to fall behind. Holmes,\\r\\nhowever, was always in training, for he had inexhaustible stores of\\r\\nnervous energy upon which to draw. His springy step never slowed until\\r\\nsuddenly, when he was a hundred yards in front of me, he halted, and I\\r\\nsaw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair. At the\\r\\nsame instant an empty dog-cart, the horse cantering, the reins trailing,\\r\\nappeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Too late, Watson, too late!” cried Holmes, as I ran panting to his\\r\\nside. “Fool that I was not to allow for that earlier train! It’s\\r\\nabduction, Watson--abduction! Murder! Heaven knows what! Block the road!\\r\\nStop the horse! That’s right. Now, jump in, and let us see if I can\\r\\nrepair the consequences of my own blunder.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had sprung into the dog-cart, and Holmes, after turning the horse,\\r\\ngave it a sharp cut with the whip, and we flew back along the road. As\\r\\nwe turned the curve, the whole stretch of road between the Hall and the\\r\\nheath was opened up. I grasped Holmes’s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the man!” I gasped. A solitary cyclist was coming towards us.\\r\\nHis head was down and his shoulders rounded, as he put every ounce of\\r\\nenergy that he possessed on to the pedals. He was flying like a racer.\\r\\nSuddenly he raised his bearded face, saw us close to him, and pulled\\r\\nup, springing from his machine. That coal-black beard was in singular\\r\\ncontrast to eyes were as bright as if he had a fever. He stared at us\\r\\nand at the dog-cart. Then a look of amazement came over his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Halloa! Stop there!” he shouted, holding his bicycle to block our road.\\r\\n“Where did you get that dog-cart? Pull up, man!” he yelled, drawing a\\r\\npistol from his side “Pull up, I say, or, by George, I’ll put a bullet\\r\\ninto your horse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re the man we want to see. Where is Miss Violet Smith?” he said, in\\r\\nhis quick, clear way.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I’m asking you. You’re in her dog-cart. You ought to know\\r\\nwhere she is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We met the dog-cart on the road. There was no one in it. We drove back\\r\\nto help the young lady.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Lord! Good Lord! What shall I do?” cried the stranger, in an\\r\\necstasy of despair. “They’ve got her, that hell-hound Woodley and the\\r\\nblackguard parson. Come, man, come, if you really are her friend. Stand\\r\\nby me and we’ll save her, if I have to leave my carcass in Charlington\\r\\nWood.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ran distractedly, his pistol in his hand, towards a gap in the hedge.\\r\\nHolmes followed him, and I, leaving the horse grazing beside the road,\\r\\nfollowed Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is where they came through,” said he, pointing to the marks of\\r\\nseveral feet upon the muddy path. “Halloa! Stop a minute! Who’s this in\\r\\nthe bush?”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a young fellow about seventeen, dressed like an ostler, with\\r\\nleather cords and gaiters. He lay upon his back, his knees drawn up, a\\r\\nterrible cut upon his head. He was insensible, but alive. A glance at\\r\\nhis wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s Peter, the groom,” cried the stranger. “He drove her. The beasts\\r\\nhave pulled him off and clubbed him. Let him lie; we can’t do him any\\r\\ngood, but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ran frantically down the path, which wound among the trees. We had\\r\\nreached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when Holmes pulled up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They didn’t go to the house. Here are their marks on the left--here,\\r\\nbeside the laurel bushes. Ah! I said so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, a woman’s shrill scream--a scream which vibrated with a\\r\\nfrenzy of horror--burst from the thick, green clump of bushes in front\\r\\nof us. It ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and a gurgle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This way! This way! They are in the bowling-alley,” cried the\\r\\nstranger, darting through the bushes. “Ah, the cowardly dogs! Follow me,\\r\\ngentlemen! Too late! too late! by the living Jingo!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by\\r\\nancient trees. On the farther side of it, under the shadow of a mighty\\r\\noak, there stood a singular group of three people. One was a woman, our\\r\\nclient, drooping and faint, a handkerchief round her mouth. Opposite her\\r\\nstood a brutal, heavy-faced, red-moustached young man, his gaitered legs\\r\\nparted wide, one arm akimbo, the other waving a riding crop, his whole\\r\\nattitude suggestive of triumphant bravado. Between them an elderly,\\r\\ngray-bearded man, wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit,\\r\\nhad evidently just completed the wedding service, for he pocketed his\\r\\nprayer-book as we appeared, and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the\\r\\nback in jovial congratulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They’re married!” I gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come on!” cried our guide, “come on!” He rushed across the glade,\\r\\nHolmes and I at his heels. As we approached, the lady staggered against\\r\\nthe trunk of the tree for support. Williamson, the ex-clergyman, bowed\\r\\nto us with mock politeness, and the bully, Woodley, advanced with a\\r\\nshout of brutal and exultant laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can take your beard off, Bob,” said he. “I know you, right enough.\\r\\nWell, you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to\\r\\nintroduce you to Mrs. Woodley.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur guide’s answer was a singular one. He snatched off the dark beard\\r\\nwhich had disguised him and threw it on the ground, disclosing a long,\\r\\nsallow, clean-shaven face below it. Then he raised his revolver and\\r\\ncovered the young ruffian, who was advancing upon him with his dangerous\\r\\nriding-crop swinging in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said our ally, “I am Bob Carruthers, and I’ll see this woman\\r\\nrighted, if I have to swing for it. I told you what I’d do if you\\r\\nmolested her, and, by the Lord! I’ll be as good as my word.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re too late. She’s my wife.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, she’s your widow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis revolver cracked, and I saw the blood spurt from the front of\\r\\nWoodley’s waistcoat. He spun round with a scream and fell upon his back,\\r\\nhis hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor. The\\r\\nold man, still clad in his surplice, burst into such a string of foul\\r\\noaths as I have never heard, and pulled out a revolver of his own, but,\\r\\nbefore he could raise it, he was looking down the barrel of Holmes’s\\r\\nweapon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Enough of this,” said my friend, coldly. “Drop that pistol! Watson,\\r\\npick it up! Hold it to his head. Thank you. You, Carruthers, give me\\r\\nthat revolver. We’ll have no more violence. Come, hand it over!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Sherlock Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Lord!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have heard of me, I see. I will represent the official police until\\r\\ntheir arrival. Here, you!” he shouted to a frightened groom, who had\\r\\nappeared at the edge of the glade. “Come here. Take this note as hard as\\r\\nyou can ride to Farnham.” He scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his\\r\\nnotebook. “Give it to the superintendent at the police-station. Until he\\r\\ncomes, I must detain you all under my personal custody.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe strong, masterful personality of Holmes dominated the tragic scene,\\r\\nand all were equally puppets in his hands. Williamson and Carruthers\\r\\nfound themselves carrying the wounded Woodley into the house, and I gave\\r\\nmy arm to the frightened girl. The injured man was laid on his bed, and\\r\\nat Holmes’s request I examined him. I carried my report to where he sat\\r\\nin the old tapestry-hung dining-room with his two prisoners before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will live,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What!” cried Carruthers, springing out of his chair. “I’ll go upstairs\\r\\nand finish him first. Do you tell me that that angel, is to be tied to\\r\\nRoaring Jack Woodley for life?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You need not concern yourself about that,” said Holmes. “There are two\\r\\nvery good reasons why she should, under no circumstances, be his wife.\\r\\nIn the first place, we are very safe in questioning Mr. Williamson’s\\r\\nright to solemnize a marriage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have been ordained,” cried the old rascal.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And also unfrocked.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Once a clergyman, always a clergyman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think not. How about the license?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had a license for the marriage. I have it here in my pocket.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you got it by trick. But, in any case a forced marriage is no\\r\\nmarriage, but it is a very serious felony, as you will discover before\\r\\nyou have finished. You’ll have time to think the point out during the\\r\\nnext ten years or so, unless I am mistaken. As to you, Carruthers, you\\r\\nwould have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I begin to think so, Mr. Holmes, but when I thought of all the\\r\\nprecaution I had taken to shield this girl--for I loved her, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nand it is the only time that ever I knew what love was--it fairly drove\\r\\nme mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and\\r\\nbully in South Africa--a man whose name is a holy terror from Kimberley\\r\\nto Johannesburg. Why, Mr. Holmes, you’ll hardly believe it, but ever\\r\\nsince that girl has been in my employment I never once let her go past\\r\\nthis house, where I knew the rascals were lurking, without following her\\r\\non my bicycle, just to see that she came to no harm. I kept my distance\\r\\nfrom her, and I wore a beard, so that she should not recognize me, for\\r\\nshe is a good and high-spirited girl, and she wouldn’t have stayed in\\r\\nmy employment long if she had thought that I was following her about the\\r\\ncountry roads.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you tell her of her danger?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because then, again, she would have left me, and I couldn’t bear to\\r\\nface that. Even if she couldn’t love me, it was a great deal to me just\\r\\nto see her dainty form about the house, and to hear the sound of her\\r\\nvoice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said I, “you call that love, Mr. Carruthers, but I should call\\r\\nit selfishness.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe the two things go together. Anyhow, I couldn’t let her go.\\r\\nBesides, with this crowd about, it was well that she should have someone\\r\\nnear to look after her. Then, when the cable came, I knew they were\\r\\nbound to make a move.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What cable?”\\r\\n\\r\\nCarruthers took a telegram from his pocket “That’s it,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was short and concise:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man is dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum!” said Holmes. “I think I see how things worked, and I can\\r\\nunderstand how this message would, as you say, bring them to a head. But\\r\\nwhile you wait, you might tell me what you can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By heaven!” said he, “if you squeal on us, Bob Carruthers, I’ll serve\\r\\nyou as you served Jack Woodley. You can bleat about the girl to your\\r\\nheart’s content, for that’s your own affair, but if you round on your\\r\\npals to this plain-clothes copper, it will be the worst day’s work that\\r\\never you did.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your reverence need not be excited,” said Holmes, lighting a cigarette.\\r\\n“The case is clear enough against you, and all I ask is a few details\\r\\nfor my private curiosity. However, if there’s any difficulty in your\\r\\ntelling me, I’ll do the talking, and then you will see how far you have\\r\\na chance of holding back your secrets. In the first place, three of you\\r\\ncame from South Africa on this game--you Williamson, you Carruthers, and\\r\\nWoodley.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lie number one,” said the old man; “I never saw either of them until\\r\\ntwo months ago, and I have never been in Africa in my life, so you can\\r\\nput that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr. Busybody Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What he says is true,” said Carruthers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, two of you came over. His reverence is our own homemade\\r\\narticle. You had known Ralph Smith in South Africa. You had reason\\r\\nto believe he would not live long. You found out that his niece would\\r\\ninherit his fortune. How’s that--eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nCarruthers nodded and Williamson swore.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was next of kin, no doubt, and you were aware that the old fellow\\r\\nwould make no will.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Couldn’t read or write,” said Carruthers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you came over, the two of you, and hunted up the girl. The idea\\r\\nwas that one of you was to marry her, and the other have a share of the\\r\\nplunder. For some reason, Woodley was chosen as the husband. Why was\\r\\nthat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We played cards for her on the voyage. He won.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. You got the young lady into your service, and there Woodley was\\r\\nto do the courting. She recognized the drunken brute that he was, and\\r\\nwould have nothing to do with him. Meanwhile, your arrangement was\\r\\nrather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the\\r\\nlady. You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, by George, I couldn’t!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was a quarrel between you. He left you in a rage, and began to\\r\\nmake his own plans independently of you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It strikes me, Williamson, there isn’t very much that we can tell this\\r\\ngentleman,” cried Carruthers, with a bitter laugh. “Yes, we quarreled,\\r\\nand he knocked me down. I am level with him on that, anyhow. Then I lost\\r\\nsight of him. That was when he picked up with this outcast padre here.\\r\\nI found that they had set up housekeeping together at this place on the\\r\\nline that she had to pass for the station. I kept my eye on her after\\r\\nthat, for I knew there was some devilry in the wind. I saw them from\\r\\ntime to time, for I was anxious to know what they were after. Two days\\r\\nago Woodley came up to my house with this cable, which showed that Ralph\\r\\nSmith was dead. He asked me if I would stand by the bargain. I said I\\r\\nwould not. He asked me if I would marry the girl myself and give him a\\r\\nshare. I said I would willingly do so, but that she would not have me.\\r\\nHe said, ‘Let us get her married first and after a week or two she may\\r\\nsee things a bit different.’ I said I would have nothing to do with\\r\\nviolence. So he went off cursing, like the foul-mouthed blackguard that\\r\\nhe was, and swearing that he would have her yet. She was leaving me this\\r\\nweek-end, and I had got a trap to take her to the station, but I was\\r\\nso uneasy in my mind that I followed her on my bicycle. She had got a\\r\\nstart, however, and before I could catch her, the mischief was done.\\r\\nThe first thing I knew about it was when I saw you two gentlemen driving\\r\\nback in her dog-cart.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate. “I have\\r\\nbeen very obtuse, Watson,” said he. “When in your report you said that\\r\\nyou had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in\\r\\nthe shrubbery, that alone should have told me all. However, we may\\r\\ncongratulate ourselves upon a curious and, in some respects, a unique\\r\\ncase. I perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive, and I am\\r\\nglad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them, so\\r\\nit is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be\\r\\npermanently damaged by their morning’s adventures. I think, Watson, that\\r\\nin your medical capacity, you might wait upon Miss Smith and tell her\\r\\nthat if she is sufficiently recovered, we shall be happy to escort her\\r\\nto her mother’s home. If she is not quite convalescent you will find\\r\\nthat a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician\\r\\nin the Midlands would probably complete the cure. As to you, Mr.\\r\\nCarruthers, I think that you have done what you could to make amends for\\r\\nyour share in an evil plot. There is my card, sir, and if my evidence\\r\\ncan be of help in your trial, it shall be at your disposal.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the whirl of our incessant activity, it has often been difficult for\\r\\nme, as the reader has probably observed, to round off my narratives, and\\r\\nto give those final details which the curious might expect. Each case\\r\\nhas been the prelude to another, and the crisis once over, the actors\\r\\nhave passed for ever out of our busy lives. I find, however, a short\\r\\nnote at the end of my manuscript dealing with this case, in which I have\\r\\nput it upon record that Miss Violet Smith did indeed inherit a large\\r\\nfortune, and that she is now the wife of Cyril Morton, the senior\\r\\npartner of Morton & Kennedy, the famous Westminster electricians.\\r\\nWilliamson and Woodley were both tried for abduction and assault, the\\r\\nformer getting seven years the latter ten. Of the fate of Carruthers,\\r\\nI have no record, but I am sure that his assault was not viewed very\\r\\ngravely by the court, since Woodley had the reputation of being a most\\r\\ndangerous ruffian, and I think that a few, months were sufficient to\\r\\nsatisfy the demands of justice.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE PRIORY SCHOOL\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at\\r\\nBaker Street, but I cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling\\r\\nthan the first appearance of Thorneycroft Huxtable, M.A., Ph.D., etc.\\r\\nHis card, which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic\\r\\ndistinctions, preceded him by a few seconds, and then he entered\\r\\nhimself--so large, so pompous, and so dignified that he was the very\\r\\nembodiment of self-possession and solidity. And yet his first action,\\r\\nwhen the door had closed behind him, was to stagger against the table,\\r\\nwhence he slipped down upon the floor, and there was that majestic\\r\\nfigure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearth-rug.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent\\r\\namazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage, which told of some sudden\\r\\nand fatal storm far out on the ocean of life. Then Holmes hurried with\\r\\na cushion for his head, and I with brandy for his lips. The heavy, white\\r\\nface was seamed with lines of trouble, the hanging pouches under the\\r\\nclosed eyes were leaden in colour, the loose mouth drooped dolorously at\\r\\nthe corners, the rolling chins were unshaven. Collar and shirt bore\\r\\nthe grime of a long journey, and the hair bristled unkempt from the\\r\\nwell-shaped head. It was a sorely stricken man who lay before us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, Watson?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolute exhaustion--possibly mere hunger and fatigue,” said I, with my\\r\\nfinger on the thready pulse, where the stream of life trickled thin and\\r\\nsmall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Return ticket from Mackleton, in the north of England,” said Holmes,\\r\\ndrawing it from the watch-pocket. “It is not twelve o’clock yet. He has\\r\\ncertainly been an early starter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe puckered eyelids had begun to quiver, and now a pair of vacant gray\\r\\neyes looked up at us. An instant later the man had scrambled on to his\\r\\nfeet, his face crimson with shame.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Forgive this weakness, Mr. Holmes, I have been a little overwrought.\\r\\nThank you, if I might have a glass of milk and a biscuit, I have no\\r\\ndoubt that I should be better. I came personally, Mr. Holmes, in order\\r\\nto insure that you would return with me. I feared that no telegram would\\r\\nconvince you of the absolute urgency of the case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When you are quite restored----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am quite well again. I cannot imagine how I came to be so weak. I\\r\\nwish you, Mr. Holmes, to come to Mackleton with me by the next train.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My colleague, Dr. Watson, could tell you that we are very busy at\\r\\npresent. I am retained in this case of the Ferrers Documents, and the\\r\\nAbergavenny murder is coming up for trial. Only a very important issue\\r\\ncould call me from London at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Important!” Our visitor threw up his hands. “Have you heard nothing of\\r\\nthe abduction of the only son of the Duke of Holdernesse?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What! the late Cabinet Minister?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. We had tried to keep it out of the papers, but there was some\\r\\nrumor in the GLOBE last night. I thought it might have reached your\\r\\nears.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shot out his long, thin arm and picked out Volume “H” in his\\r\\nencyclopaedia of reference.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Holdernesse, 6th Duke, K.G., P.C.’--half the alphabet! ‘Baron\\r\\nBeverley, Earl of Carston’--dear me, what a list! ‘Lord Lieutenant\\r\\nof Hallamshire since 1900. Married Edith, daughter of Sir Charles\\r\\nAppledore, 1888. Heir and only child, Lord Saltire. Owns about two\\r\\nhundred and fifty thousand acres. Minerals in Lancashire and Wales.\\r\\nAddress: Carlton House Terrace; Holdernesse Hall, Hallamshire; Carston\\r\\nCastle, Bangor, Wales. Lord of the Admiralty, 1872; Chief Secretary of\\r\\nState for----’ Well, well, this man is certainly one of the greatest\\r\\nsubjects of the Crown!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The greatest and perhaps the wealthiest. I am aware, Mr. Holmes, that\\r\\nyou take a very high line in professional matters, and that you are\\r\\nprepared to work for the work’s sake. I may tell you, however, that his\\r\\nGrace has already intimated that a check for five thousand pounds will\\r\\nbe handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is, and\\r\\nanother thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a princely offer,” said Holmes. “Watson, I think that we shall\\r\\naccompany Dr. Huxtable back to the north of England. And now, Dr.\\r\\nHuxtable, when you have consumed that milk, you will kindly tell me what\\r\\nhas happened, when it happened, how it happened, and, finally, what Dr.\\r\\nThorneycroft Huxtable, of the Priory School, near Mackleton, has to do\\r\\nwith the matter, and why he comes three days after an event--the state\\r\\nof your chin gives the date--to ask for my humble services.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits. The light had come back\\r\\nto his eyes and the colour to his cheeks, as he set himself with great\\r\\nvigour and lucidity to explain the situation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must inform you, gentlemen, that the Priory is a preparatory school,\\r\\nof which I am the founder and principal. HUXTABLE’S SIDELIGHTS ON HORACE\\r\\nmay possibly recall my name to your memories. The Priory is, without\\r\\nexception, the best and most select preparatory school in England. Lord\\r\\nLeverstoke, the Earl of Blackwater, Sir Cathcart Soames--they all have\\r\\nintrusted their sons to me. But I felt that my school had reached its\\r\\nzenith when, weeks ago, the Duke of Holdernesse sent Mr. James Wilder,\\r\\nhis secretary, with intimation that young Lord Saltire, ten years old,\\r\\nhis only son and heir, was about to be committed to my charge. Little\\r\\ndid I think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing\\r\\nmisfortune of my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer\\r\\nterm. He was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may\\r\\ntell you--I trust that I am not indiscreet, but half-confidences are\\r\\nabsurd in such a case--that he was not entirely happy at home. It is an\\r\\nopen secret that the Duke’s married life had not been a peaceful one,\\r\\nand the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent, the Duchess\\r\\ntaking up her residence in the south of France. This had occurred very\\r\\nshortly before, and the boy’s sympathies are known to have been strongly\\r\\nwith his mother. He moped after her departure from Holdernesse Hall,\\r\\nand it was for this reason that the Duke desired to send him to my\\r\\nestablishment. In a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was\\r\\napparently absolutely happy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was last seen on the night of May 13th--that is, the night of last\\r\\nMonday. His room was on the second floor and was approached through\\r\\nanother larger room, in which two boys were sleeping. These boys saw and\\r\\nheard nothing, so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass out\\r\\nthat way. His window was open, and there is a stout ivy plant leading to\\r\\nthe ground. We could trace no footmarks below, but it is sure that this\\r\\nis the only possible exit.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His absence was discovered at seven o’clock on Tuesday morning. His bed\\r\\nhad been slept in. He had dressed himself fully, before going off, in\\r\\nhis usual school suit of black Eton jacket and dark gray trousers. There\\r\\nwere no signs that anyone had entered the room, and it is quite certain\\r\\nthat anything in the nature of cries or a struggle would have been\\r\\nheard, since Caunter, the elder boy in the inner room, is a very light\\r\\nsleeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Lord Saltire’s disappearance was discovered, I at once called a\\r\\nroll of the whole establishment--boys, masters, and servants. It was\\r\\nthen that we ascertained that Lord Saltire had not been alone in his\\r\\nflight. Heidegger, the German master, was missing. His room was on the\\r\\nsecond floor, at the farther end of the building, facing the same way\\r\\nas Lord Saltire’s. His bed had also been slept in, but he had apparently\\r\\ngone away partly dressed, since his shirt and socks were lying on the\\r\\nfloor. He had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy, for we could see\\r\\nthe marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn. His bicycle was\\r\\nkept in a small shed beside this lawn, and it also was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He had been with me for two years, and came with the best references,\\r\\nbut he was a silent, morose man, not very popular either with masters\\r\\nor boys. No trace could be found of the fugitives, and now, on Thursday\\r\\nmorning, we are as ignorant as we were on Tuesday. Inquiry was, of\\r\\ncourse, made at once at Holdernesse Hall. It is only a few miles away,\\r\\nand we imagined that, in some sudden attack of homesickness, he had\\r\\ngone back to his father, but nothing had been heard of him. The Duke is\\r\\ngreatly agitated, and, as to me, you have seen yourselves the state of\\r\\nnervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have\\r\\nreduced me. Mr. Holmes, if ever you put forward your full powers, I\\r\\nimplore you to do so now, for never in your life could you have a case\\r\\nwhich is more worthy of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the statement\\r\\nof the unhappy schoolmaster. His drawn brows and the deep furrow\\r\\nbetween them showed that he needed no exhortation to concentrate all\\r\\nhis attention upon a problem which, apart from the tremendous interests\\r\\ninvolved must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the\\r\\nunusual. He now drew out his notebook and jotted down one or two\\r\\nmemoranda.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner,” said he,\\r\\nseverely. “You start me on my investigation with a very serious\\r\\nhandicap. It is inconceivable, for example, that this ivy and this lawn\\r\\nwould have yielded nothing to an expert observer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not to blame, Mr. Holmes. His Grace was extremely desirous to\\r\\navoid all public scandal. He was afraid of his family unhappiness being\\r\\ndragged before the world. He has a deep horror of anything of the kind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But there has been some official investigation?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, and it has proved most disappointing. An apparent clue was\\r\\nat once obtained, since a boy and a young man were reported to have been\\r\\nseen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train. Only last night\\r\\nwe had news that the couple had been hunted down in Liverpool, and they\\r\\nprove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand. Then it\\r\\nwas that in my despair and disappointment, after a sleepless night, I\\r\\ncame straight to you by the early train.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was\\r\\nbeing followed up?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was entirely dropped.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that three days have been wasted. The affair has been most\\r\\ndeplorably handled.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I feel it and admit it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution. I shall be\\r\\nvery happy to look into it. Have you been able to trace any connection\\r\\nbetween the missing boy and this German master?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was he in the master’s class?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he never exchanged a word with him, so far as I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is certainly very singular. Had the boy a bicycle?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was any other bicycle missing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that certain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now, you do not mean to seriously suggest that this German rode\\r\\noff upon a bicycle in the dead of the night, bearing the boy in his\\r\\narms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then what is the theory in your mind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The bicycle may have been a blind. It may have been hidden somewhere,\\r\\nand the pair gone off on foot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so, but it seems rather an absurd blind, does it not? Were there\\r\\nother bicycles in this shed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Several.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would he not have hidden a couple, had he desired to give the idea that\\r\\nthey had gone off upon them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose he would.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course he would. The blind theory won’t do. But the incident is an\\r\\nadmirable starting-point for an investigation. After all, a bicycle\\r\\nis not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy. One other question. Did\\r\\nanyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did he get any letters?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, one letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From whom?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“From his father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you open the boys’ letters?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know it was from the father?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The coat of arms was on the envelope, and it was addressed in the\\r\\nDuke’s peculiar stiff hand. Besides, the Duke remembers having written.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When had he a letter before that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not for several days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had he ever one from France?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, never.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see the point of my questions, of course. Either the boy was\\r\\ncarried off by force or he went of his own free will. In the latter\\r\\ncase, you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed\\r\\nto make so young a lad do such a thing. If he has had no visitors, that\\r\\nprompting must have come in letters; hence I try to find out who were\\r\\nhis correspondents.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear I cannot help you much. His only correspondent, so far as I\\r\\nknow, was his own father.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance. Were the\\r\\nrelations between father and son very friendly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His Grace is never very friendly with anyone. He is completely immersed\\r\\nin large public questions, and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary\\r\\nemotions. But he was always kind to the boy in his own way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the sympathies of the latter were with the mother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did he say so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Duke, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heaven, no!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how could you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had some confidential talks with Mr. James Wilder, his Grace’s\\r\\nsecretary. It was he who gave me the information about Lord Saltire’s\\r\\nfeelings.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. By the way, that last letter of the Dukes--was it found in the\\r\\nboy’s room after he was gone?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he had taken it with him. I think, Mr. Holmes, it is time that we\\r\\nwere leaving for Euston.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will order a four-wheeler. In a quarter of an hour, we shall be at\\r\\nyour service. If you are telegraphing home, Mr. Huxtable, it would\\r\\nbe well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that\\r\\nthe inquiry is still going on in Liverpool, or wherever else that red\\r\\nherring led your pack. In the meantime I will do a little quiet work at\\r\\nyour own doors, and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old\\r\\nhounds like Watson and myself may get a sniff of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThat evening found us in the cold, bracing atmosphere of the Peak\\r\\ncountry, in which Dr. Huxtable’s famous school is situated. It was\\r\\nalready dark when we reached it. A card was lying on the hall table,\\r\\nand the butler whispered something to his master, who turned to us with\\r\\nagitation in every heavy feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Duke is here,” said he. “The Duke and Mr. Wilder are in the study.\\r\\nCome, gentlemen, and I will introduce you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was, of course, familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman,\\r\\nbut the man himself was very different from his representation. He was a\\r\\ntall and stately person, scrupulously dressed, with a drawn, thin face,\\r\\nand a nose which was grotesquely curved and long. His complexion was\\r\\nof a dead pallor, which was more startling by contrast with a long,\\r\\ndwindling beard of vivid red, which flowed down over his white waistcoat\\r\\nwith his watch-chain gleaming through its fringe. Such was the stately\\r\\npresence who looked stonily at us from the centre of Dr. Huxtable’s\\r\\nhearthrug. Beside him stood a very young man, whom I understood to\\r\\nbe Wilder, the private secretary. He was small, nervous, alert with\\r\\nintelligent light-blue eyes and mobile features. It was he who at once,\\r\\nin an incisive and positive tone, opened the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I called this morning, Dr. Huxtable, too late to prevent you from\\r\\nstarting for London. I learned that your object was to invite Mr.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes to undertake the conduct of this case. His Grace is\\r\\nsurprised, Dr. Huxtable, that you should have taken such a step without\\r\\nconsulting him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I learned that the police had failed----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His Grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But surely, Mr. Wilder----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are well aware, Dr. Huxtable, that his Grace is particularly\\r\\nanxious to avoid all public scandal. He prefers to take as few people as\\r\\npossible into his confidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The matter can be easily remedied,” said the brow-beaten doctor; “Mr.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes can return to London by the morning train.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hardly that, Doctor, hardly that,” said Holmes, in his blandest voice.\\r\\n“This northern air is invigorating and pleasant, so I propose to spend a\\r\\nfew days upon your moors, and to occupy my mind as best I may. Whether\\r\\nI have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is, of course, for\\r\\nyou to decide.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of\\r\\nindecision, from which he was rescued by the deep, sonorous voice of the\\r\\nred-bearded Duke, which boomed out like a dinner-gong.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I agree with Mr. Wilder, Dr. Huxtable, that you would have done wisely\\r\\nto consult me. But since Mr. Holmes has already been taken into your\\r\\nconfidence, it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves\\r\\nof his services. Far from going to the inn, Mr. Holmes, I should be\\r\\npleased if you would come and stay with me at Holdernesse Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thank your Grace. For the purposes of my investigation, I think that\\r\\nit would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just as you like, Mr. Holmes. Any information which Mr. Wilder or I can\\r\\ngive you is, of course, at your disposal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will probably be necessary for me to see you at the Hall,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “I would only ask you now, sir, whether you have formed any\\r\\nexplanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your\\r\\nson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No sir I have not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me if I allude to that which is painful to you, but I have no\\r\\nalternative. Do you think that the Duchess had anything to do with the\\r\\nmatter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe great minister showed perceptible hesitation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not think so,” he said, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped\\r\\nfor the purpose of levying ransom. You have not had any demand of the\\r\\nsort?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One more question, your Grace. I understand that you wrote to your son\\r\\nupon the day when this incident occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I wrote upon the day before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. But he received it on that day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or\\r\\ninduced him to take such a step?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you post that letter yourself?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nobleman’s reply was interrupted by his secretary, who broke in with\\r\\nsome heat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“His Grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself,” said he.\\r\\n“This letter was laid with others upon the study table, and I myself put\\r\\nthem in the post-bag.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are sure this one was among them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I observed it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How many letters did your Grace write that day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twenty or thirty. I have a large correspondence. But surely this is\\r\\nsomewhat irrelevant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not entirely,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For my own part,” the Duke continued, “I have advised the police to\\r\\nturn their attention to the south of France. I have already said that I\\r\\ndo not believe that the Duchess would encourage so monstrous an action,\\r\\nbut the lad had the most wrong-headed opinions, and it is possible that\\r\\nhe may have fled to her, aided and abetted by this German. I think, Dr.\\r\\nHuxtable, that we will now return to the Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see that there were other questions which Holmes would have\\r\\nwished to put, but the nobleman’s abrupt manner showed that the\\r\\ninterview was at an end. It was evident that to his intensely\\r\\naristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs\\r\\nwith a stranger was most abhorrent, and that he feared lest every\\r\\nfresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed\\r\\ncorners of his ducal history.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the nobleman and his secretary had left, my friend flung himself at\\r\\nonce with characteristic eagerness into the investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boy’s chamber was carefully examined, and yielded nothing save the\\r\\nabsolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could\\r\\nhave escaped. The German master’s room and effects gave no further clue.\\r\\nIn his case a trailer of ivy had given way under his weight, and we saw\\r\\nby the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come\\r\\ndown. That one dint in the short, green grass was the only material\\r\\nwitness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes left the house alone, and only returned after eleven.\\r\\nHe had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this\\r\\nhe brought into my room, where he laid it out on the bed, and, having\\r\\nbalanced the lamp in the middle of it, he began to smoke over it, and\\r\\noccasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of\\r\\nhis pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC: HOLMES’ MAP OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SCHOOL.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This case grows upon me, Watson,” said he. “There are decidedly some\\r\\npoints of interest in connection with it. In this early stage, I want\\r\\nyou to realize those geographical features which may have a good deal to\\r\\ndo with our investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at this map. This dark square is the Priory School. I’ll put a pin\\r\\nin it. Now, this line is the main road. You see that it runs east and\\r\\nwest past the school, and you see also that there is no side road for\\r\\na mile either way. If these two folk passed away by road, it was THIS\\r\\nroad.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By a singular and happy chance, we are able to some extent to check\\r\\nwhat passed along this road during the night in question. At this point,\\r\\nwhere my pipe is now resting, a county constable was on duty from twelve\\r\\nto six. It is, as you perceive, the first cross-road on the east side.\\r\\nThis man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant,\\r\\nand he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way\\r\\nunseen. I have spoken with this policeman to-night and he appears to me\\r\\nto be a perfectly reliable person. That blocks this end. We have now to\\r\\ndeal with the other. There is an inn here, the Red Bull, the landlady\\r\\nof which was ill. She had sent to Mackleton for a doctor, but he did not\\r\\narrive until morning, being absent at another case. The people at the\\r\\ninn were alert all night, awaiting his coming, and one or other of them\\r\\nseems to have continually had an eye upon the road. They declare that no\\r\\none passed. If their evidence is good, then we are fortunate enough to\\r\\nbe able to block the west, and also to be able to say that the fugitives\\r\\ndid NOT use the road at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the bicycle?” I objected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. We will come to the bicycle presently. To continue our\\r\\nreasoning: if these people did not go by the road, they must have\\r\\ntraversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the\\r\\nhouse. That is certain. Let us weigh the one against the other. On the\\r\\nsouth of the house is, as you perceive, a large district of arable land,\\r\\ncut up into small fields, with stone walls between them. There, I admit\\r\\nthat a bicycle is impossible. We can dismiss the idea. We turn to the\\r\\ncountry on the north. Here there lies a grove of trees, marked as the\\r\\n‘Ragged Shaw,’ and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor,\\r\\nLower Gill Moor, extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upward.\\r\\nHere, at one side of this wilderness, is Holdernesse Hall, ten miles by\\r\\nroad, but only six across the moor. It is a peculiarly desolate plain. A\\r\\nfew moor farmers have small holdings, where they rear sheep and cattle.\\r\\nExcept these, the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until\\r\\nyou come to the Chesterfield high road. There is a church there,\\r\\nyou see, a few cottages, and an inn. Beyond that the hills become\\r\\nprecipitous. Surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the bicycle?” I persisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well!” said Holmes, impatiently. “A good cyclist does not need a\\r\\nhigh road. The moor is intersected with paths, and the moon was at the\\r\\nfull. Halloa! what is this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was an agitated knock at the door, and an instant afterwards Dr.\\r\\nHuxtable was in the room. In his hand he held a blue cricket-cap with a\\r\\nwhite chevron on the peak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At last we have a clue!” he cried. “Thank heaven! at last we are on the\\r\\ndear boy’s track! It is his cap.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was it found?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor. They left on Tuesday.\\r\\nTo-day the police traced them down and examined their caravan. This was\\r\\nfound.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do they account for it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They shuffled and lied--said that they found it on the moor on Tuesday\\r\\nmorning. They know where he is, the rascals! Thank goodness, they are\\r\\nall safe under lock and key. Either the fear of the law or the Duke’s\\r\\npurse will certainly get out of them all that they know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So far, so good,” said Holmes, when the doctor had at last left the\\r\\nroom. “It at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the\\r\\nLower Gill Moor that we must hope for results. The police have really\\r\\ndone nothing locally, save the arrest of these gipsies. Look here,\\r\\nWatson! There is a watercourse across the moor. You see it marked here\\r\\nin the map. In some parts it widens into a morass. This is particularly\\r\\nso in the region between Holdernesse Hall and the school. It is vain to\\r\\nlook elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather, but at THAT point there\\r\\nis certainly a chance of some record being left. I will call you early\\r\\nto-morrow morning, and you and I will try if we can throw some little\\r\\nlight upon the mystery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was just breaking when I woke to find the long, thin form of\\r\\nHolmes by my bedside. He was fully dressed, and had apparently already\\r\\nbeen out.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have done the lawn and the bicycle shed,” said he. “I have also had\\r\\na rumble through the Ragged Shaw. Now, Watson, there is cocoa ready in\\r\\nthe next room. I must beg you to hurry, for we have a great day before\\r\\nus.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes shone, and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration of the\\r\\nmaster workman who sees his work lie ready before him. A very different\\r\\nHolmes, this active, alert man, from the introspective and pallid\\r\\ndreamer of Baker Street. I felt, as I looked upon that supple figure,\\r\\nalive with nervous energy, that it was indeed a strenuous day that\\r\\nawaited us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet it opened in the blackest disappointment. With high hopes we\\r\\nstruck across the peaty, russet moor, intersected with a thousand sheep\\r\\npaths, until we came to the broad, light-green belt which marked the\\r\\nmorass between us and Holdernesse. Certainly, if the lad had gone\\r\\nhomeward, he must have passed this, and he could not pass it without\\r\\nleaving his traces. But no sign of him or the German could be seen. With\\r\\na darkening face my friend strode along the margin, eagerly observant\\r\\nof every muddy stain upon the mossy surface. Sheep-marks there were\\r\\nin profusion, and at one place, some miles down, cows had left their\\r\\ntracks. Nothing more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Check number one,” said Holmes, looking gloomily over the rolling\\r\\nexpanse of the moor. “There is another morass down yonder, and a narrow\\r\\nneck between. Halloa! halloa! halloa! what have we here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had come on a small black ribbon of pathway. In the middle of it,\\r\\nclearly marked on the sodden soil, was the track of a bicycle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurrah!” I cried. “We have it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Holmes was shaking his head, and his face was puzzled and expectant\\r\\nrather than joyous.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A bicycle, certainly, but not THE bicycle,” said he. “I am familiar\\r\\nwith forty-two different impressions left by tires. This, as you\\r\\nperceive, is a Dunlop, with a patch upon the outer cover. Heidegger’s\\r\\ntires were Palmer’s, leaving longitudinal stripes. Aveling, the\\r\\nmathematical master, was sure upon the point. Therefore, it is not\\r\\nHeidegger’s track.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The boy’s, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Possibly, if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession.\\r\\nBut this we have utterly failed to do. This track, as you perceive, was\\r\\nmade by a rider who was going from the direction of the school.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Or towards it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my dear Watson. The more deeply sunk impression is, of course,\\r\\nthe hind wheel, upon which the weight rests. You perceive several places\\r\\nwhere it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the\\r\\nfront one. It was undoubtedly heading away from the school. It may or\\r\\nmay not be connected with our inquiry, but we will follow it backwards\\r\\nbefore we go any farther.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did so, and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as\\r\\nwe emerged from the boggy portion of the moor. Following the path\\r\\nbackwards, we picked out another spot, where a spring trickled across\\r\\nit. Here, once again, was the mark of the bicycle, though nearly\\r\\nobliterated by the hoofs of cows. After that there was no sign, but\\r\\nthe path ran right on into Ragged Shaw, the wood which backed on to the\\r\\nschool. From this wood the cycle must have emerged. Holmes sat down on\\r\\na boulder and rested his chin in his hands. I had smoked two cigarettes\\r\\nbefore he moved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well,” said he, at last. “It is, of course, possible that a\\r\\ncunning man might change the tires of his bicycle in order to leave\\r\\nunfamiliar tracks. A criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man\\r\\nwhom I should be proud to do business with. We will leave this question\\r\\nundecided and hark back to our morass again, for we have left a good\\r\\ndeal unexplored.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion\\r\\nof the moor, and soon our perseverance was gloriously rewarded. Right\\r\\nacross the lower part of the bog lay a miry path. Holmes gave a cry\\r\\nof delight as he approached it. An impression like a fine bundle of\\r\\ntelegraph wires ran down the centre of it. It was the Palmer tires.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is Herr Heidegger, sure enough!” cried Holmes, exultantly. “My\\r\\nreasoning seems to have been pretty sound, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I congratulate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we have a long way still to go. Kindly walk clear of the path. Now\\r\\nlet us follow the trail. I fear that it will not lead very far.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe found, however, as we advanced that this portion of the moor is\\r\\nintersected with soft patches, and, though we frequently lost sight of\\r\\nthe track, we always succeeded in picking it up once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you observe,” said Holmes, “that the rider is now undoubtedly\\r\\nforcing the pace? There can be no doubt of it. Look at this impression,\\r\\nwhere you get both tires clear. The one is as deep as the other.\\r\\nThat can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the\\r\\nhandle-bar, as a man does when he is sprinting. By Jove! he has had a\\r\\nfall.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a broad, irregular smudge covering some yards of the track.\\r\\nThen there were a few footmarks, and the tire reappeared once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A side-slip,” I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse. To my horror I\\r\\nperceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson. On the\\r\\npath, too, and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bad!” said Holmes. “Bad! Stand clear, Watson! Not an unnecessary\\r\\nfootstep! What do I read here? He fell wounded--he stood up--he\\r\\nremounted--he proceeded. But there is no other track. Cattle on this\\r\\nside path. He was surely not gored by a bull? Impossible! But I see no\\r\\ntraces of anyone else. We must push on, Watson. Surely, with stains as\\r\\nwell as the track to guide us, he cannot escape us now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur search was not a very long one. The tracks of the tire began to\\r\\ncurve fantastically upon the wet and shining path. Suddenly, as I\\r\\nlooked ahead, the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick\\r\\ngorse-bushes. Out of them we dragged a bicycle, Palmer-tired, one pedal\\r\\nbent, and the whole front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with\\r\\nblood. On the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting. We\\r\\nran round, and there lay the unfortunate rider. He was a tall man,\\r\\nfull-bearded, with spectacles, one glass of which had been knocked out.\\r\\nThe cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head, which had\\r\\ncrushed in part of his skull. That he could have gone on after receiving\\r\\nsuch an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man. He\\r\\nwore shoes, but no socks, and his open coat disclosed a nightshirt\\r\\nbeneath it. It was undoubtedly the German master.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned the body over reverently, and examined it with great\\r\\nattention. He then sat in deep thought for a time, and I could see\\r\\nby his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not, in his opinion,\\r\\nadvanced us much in our inquiry.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a little difficult to know what to do, Watson,” said he, at last.\\r\\n“My own inclinations are to push this inquiry on, for we have already\\r\\nlost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour. On the\\r\\nother hand, we are bound to inform the police of the discovery, and to\\r\\nsee that this poor fellow’s body is looked after.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could take a note back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I need your company and assistance. Wait a bit! There is a fellow\\r\\ncutting peat up yonder. Bring him over here, and he will guide the\\r\\npolice.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI brought the peasant across, and Holmes dispatched the frightened man\\r\\nwith a note to Dr. Huxtable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson,” said he, “we have picked up two clues this morning. One\\r\\nis the bicycle with the Palmer tire, and we see what that has led to.\\r\\nThe other is the bicycle with the patched Dunlop. Before we start to\\r\\ninvestigate that, let us try to realize what we do know, so as to make\\r\\nthe most of it, and to separate the essential from the accidental.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“First of all, I wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of\\r\\nhis own free-will. He got down from his window and he went off, either\\r\\nalone or with someone. That is sure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI assented.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, now, let us turn to this unfortunate German master. The boy was\\r\\nfully dressed when he fled. Therefore, he foresaw what he would do.\\r\\nBut the German went without his socks. He certainly acted on very short\\r\\nnotice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why did he go? Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the flight of\\r\\nthe boy, because he wished to overtake him and bring him back. He seized\\r\\nhis bicycle, pursued the lad, and in pursuing him met his death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it would seem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I come to the critical part of my argument. The natural action of\\r\\na man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him. He would know\\r\\nthat he could overtake him. But the German does not do so. He turns to\\r\\nhis bicycle. I am told that he was an excellent cyclist. He would not do\\r\\nthis, if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The other bicycle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us continue our reconstruction. He meets his death five miles\\r\\nfrom the school--not by a bullet, mark you, which even a lad might\\r\\nconceivably discharge, but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm.\\r\\nThe lad, then, HAD a companion in his flight. And the flight was a swift\\r\\none, since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake\\r\\nthem. Yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy. What do\\r\\nwe find? A few cattle-tracks, nothing more. I took a wide sweep round,\\r\\nand there is no path within fifty yards. Another cyclist could have\\r\\nhad nothing to do with the actual murder, nor were there any human\\r\\nfoot-marks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Holmes,” I cried, “this is impossible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Admirable!” he said. “A most illuminating remark. It IS impossible as I\\r\\nstate it, and therefore I must in some respect have stated it wrong. Yet\\r\\nyou saw for yourself. Can you suggest any fallacy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He could not have fractured his skull in a fall?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In a morass, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am at my wit’s end.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut, tut, we have solved some worse problems. At least we have plenty\\r\\nof material, if we can only use it. Come, then, and, having exhausted\\r\\nthe Palmer, let us see what the Dunlop with the patched cover has to\\r\\noffer us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe picked up the track and followed it onward for some distance, but\\r\\nsoon the moor rose into a long, heather-tufted curve, and we left the\\r\\nwatercourse behind us. No further help from tracks could be hoped for.\\r\\nAt the spot where we saw the last of the Dunlop tire it might equally\\r\\nhave led to Holdernesse Hall, the stately towers of which rose some\\r\\nmiles to our left, or to a low, gray village which lay in front of us\\r\\nand marked the position of the Chesterfield high road.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we approached the forbidding and squalid inn, with the sign of a\\r\\ngame-cock above the door, Holmes gave a sudden groan, and clutched me\\r\\nby the shoulder to save himself from falling. He had had one of those\\r\\nviolent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. With difficulty\\r\\nhe limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a\\r\\nblack clay pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are you, Mr. Reuben Hayes?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, and how do you get my name so pat?” the countryman\\r\\nanswered, with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s printed on the board above your head. It’s easy to see a man\\r\\nwho is master of his own house. I suppose you haven’t such a thing as a\\r\\ncarriage in your stables?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can hardly put my foot to the ground.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t put it to the ground.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can’t walk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then hop.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Reuben Hayes’s manner was far from gracious, but Holmes took it with\\r\\nadmirable good-humour.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, my man,” said he. “This is really rather an awkward fix for\\r\\nme. I don’t mind how I get on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Neither do I,” said the morose landlord.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The matter is very important. I would offer you a sovereign for the use\\r\\nof a bicycle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlord pricked up his ears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where do you want to go?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Holdernesse Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pals of the Dook, I suppose?” said the landlord, surveying our\\r\\nmud-stained garments with ironical eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed good-naturedly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He’ll be glad to see us, anyhow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because we bring him news of his lost son.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlord gave a very visible start.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, you’re on his track?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has been heard of in Liverpool. They expect to get him every hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain a swift change passed over the heavy, unshaven face. His manner\\r\\nwas suddenly genial.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve less reason to wish the Dook well than most men,” said he, “for\\r\\nI was head coachman once, and cruel bad he treated me. It was him that\\r\\nsacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn-chandler. But\\r\\nI’m glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in Liverpool, and I’ll\\r\\nhelp you to take the news to the Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes. “We’ll have some food first. Then you can bring\\r\\nround the bicycle.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t got a bicycle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes held up a sovereign.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you, man, that I haven’t got one. I’ll let you have two horses\\r\\nas far as the Hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well,” said Holmes, “we’ll talk about it when we’ve had something\\r\\nto eat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were left alone in the stone-flagged kitchen, it was astonishing\\r\\nhow rapidly that sprained ankle recovered. It was nearly nightfall, and\\r\\nwe had eaten nothing since early morning, so that we spent some time\\r\\nover our meal. Holmes was lost in thought, and once or twice he walked\\r\\nover to the window and stared earnestly out. It opened on to a squalid\\r\\ncourtyard. In the far corner was a smithy, where a grimy lad was at\\r\\nwork. On the other side were the stables. Holmes had sat down again\\r\\nafter one of these excursions, when he suddenly sprang out of his chair\\r\\nwith a loud exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By heaven, Watson, I believe that I’ve got it!” he cried. “Yes, yes, it\\r\\nmust be so. Watson, do you remember seeing any cow-tracks to-day?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, several.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, everywhere. They were at the morass, and again on the path, and\\r\\nagain near where poor Heidegger met his death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. Well, now, Watson, how many cows did you see on the moor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t remember seeing any.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Strange, Watson, that we should see tracks all along our line, but\\r\\nnever a cow on the whole moor. Very strange, Watson, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is strange.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson, make an effort, throw your mind back. Can you see those\\r\\ntracks upon the path?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that, Watson,”--he\\r\\narranged a number of bread-crumbs in this fashion--: : : : :--“and\\r\\nsometimes like this”--: . : . : . : .--“and occasionally like this”--. :\\r\\n. : . : . “Can you remember that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I cannot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I can. I could swear to it. However, we will go back at our\\r\\nleisure and verify it. What a blind beetle I have been, not to draw my\\r\\nconclusion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what is your conclusion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only that it is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and gallops. By\\r\\nGeorge! Watson, it was no brain of a country publican that thought out\\r\\nsuch a blind as that. The coast seems to be clear, save for that lad in\\r\\nthe smithy. Let us slip out and see what we can see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were two rough-haired, unkempt horses in the tumble-down stable.\\r\\nHolmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old shoes, but newly shod--old shoes, but new nails. This case deserves\\r\\nto be a classic. Let us go across to the smithy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lad continued his work without regarding us. I saw Holmes’s eye\\r\\ndarting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood which was\\r\\nscattered about the floor. Suddenly, however, we heard a step behind\\r\\nus, and there was the landlord, his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage\\r\\neyes, his swarthy features convulsed with passion. He held a short,\\r\\nmetal-headed stick in his hand, and he advanced in so menacing a fashion\\r\\nthat I was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You infernal spies!” the man cried. “What are you doing there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Mr. Reuben Hayes,” said Holmes, coolly, “one might think that you\\r\\nwere afraid of our finding something out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man mastered himself with a violent effort, and his grim mouth\\r\\nloosened into a false laugh, which was more menacing than his frown.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re welcome to all you can find out in my smithy,” said he. “But\\r\\nlook here, mister, I don’t care for folk poking about my place without\\r\\nmy leave, so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the\\r\\nbetter I shall be pleased.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right, Mr. Hayes, no harm meant,” said Holmes. “We have been having\\r\\na look at your horses, but I think I’ll walk, after all. It’s not far, I\\r\\nbelieve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not more than two miles to the Hall gates. That’s the road to the\\r\\nleft.” He watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe did not go very far along the road, for Holmes stopped the instant\\r\\nthat the curve hid us from the landlord’s view.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were warm, as the children say, at that inn,” said he. “I seem\\r\\nto grow colder every step that I take away from it. No, no, I can’t\\r\\npossibly leave it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am convinced,” said I, “that this Reuben Hayes knows all about it. A\\r\\nmore self-evident villain I never saw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! he impressed you in that way, did he? There are the horses, there\\r\\nis the smithy. Yes, it is an interesting place, this Fighting Cock. I\\r\\nthink we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA long, sloping hillside, dotted with gray limestone boulders, stretched\\r\\nbehind us. We had turned off the road, and were making our way up\\r\\nthe hill, when, looking in the direction of Holdernesse Hall, I saw a\\r\\ncyclist coming swiftly along.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get down, Watson!” cried Holmes, with a heavy hand upon my shoulder. We\\r\\nhad hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road. Amid\\r\\na rolling cloud of dust, I caught a glimpse of a pale, agitated face--a\\r\\nface with horror in every lineament, the mouth open, the eyes staring\\r\\nwildly in front. It was like some strange caricature of the dapper James\\r\\nWilder whom we had seen the night before.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Duke’s secretary!” cried Holmes. “Come, Watson, let us see what he\\r\\ndoes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe scrambled from rock to rock, until in a few moments we had made\\r\\nour way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn.\\r\\nWilder’s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it. No one was\\r\\nmoving about the house, nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the\\r\\nwindows. Slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the\\r\\nhigh towers of Holdernesse Hall. Then, in the gloom, we saw the two\\r\\nside-lamps of a trap light up in the stable-yard of the inn, and shortly\\r\\nafterwards heard the rattle of hoofs, as it wheeled out into the road\\r\\nand tore off at a furious pace in the direction of Chesterfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of that, Watson?” Holmes whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It looks like a flight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A single man in a dog-cart, so far as I could see. Well, it certainly\\r\\nwas not Mr. James Wilder, for there he is at the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA red square of light had sprung out of the darkness. In the middle of\\r\\nit was the black figure of the secretary, his head advanced, peering out\\r\\ninto the night. It was evident that he was expecting someone. Then at\\r\\nlast there were steps in the road, a second figure was visible for an\\r\\ninstant against the light, the door shut, and all was black once more.\\r\\nFive minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the Fighting\\r\\nCock,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The bar is on the other side.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. These are what one may call the private guests. Now, what in\\r\\nthe world is Mr. James Wilder doing in that den at this hour of night,\\r\\nand who is the companion who comes to meet him there? Come, Watson,\\r\\nwe must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more\\r\\nclosely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTogether we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the\\r\\ninn. The bicycle still leaned against the wall. Holmes struck a match\\r\\nand held it to the back wheel, and I heard him chuckle as the light fell\\r\\nupon a patched Dunlop tire. Up above us was the lighted window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must have a peep through that, Watson. If you bend your back and\\r\\nsupport yourself upon the wall, I think that I can manage.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAn instant later, his feet were on my shoulders, but he was hardly up\\r\\nbefore he was down again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, my friend,” said he, “our day’s work has been quite long enough.\\r\\nI think that we have gathered all that we can. It’s a long walk to the\\r\\nschool, and the sooner we get started the better.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the moor, nor\\r\\nwould he enter the school when he reached it, but went on to Mackleton\\r\\nStation, whence he could send some telegrams. Late at night I heard him\\r\\nconsoling Dr. Huxtable, prostrated by the tragedy of his master’s death,\\r\\nand later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been\\r\\nwhen he started in the morning. “All goes well, my friend,” said he. “I\\r\\npromise that before to-morrow evening we shall have reached the solution\\r\\nof the mystery.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt eleven o’clock next morning my friend and I were walking up the\\r\\nfamous yew avenue of Holdernesse Hall. We were ushered through the\\r\\nmagnificent Elizabethan doorway and into his Grace’s study. There we\\r\\nfound Mr. James Wilder, demure and courtly, but with some trace of that\\r\\nwild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in\\r\\nhis twitching features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have come to see his Grace? I am sorry, but the fact is that the\\r\\nDuke is far from well. He has been very much upset by the tragic news.\\r\\nWe received a telegram from Dr. Huxtable yesterday afternoon, which told\\r\\nus of your discovery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must see the Duke, Mr. Wilder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he is in his room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I must go to his room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe he is in his bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will see him there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was\\r\\nuseless to argue with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, Mr. Holmes, I will tell him that you are here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour’s delay, the great nobleman appeared. His face was more\\r\\ncadaverous than ever, his shoulders had rounded, and he seemed to me\\r\\nto be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before. He\\r\\ngreeted us with a stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk, his\\r\\nred beard streaming down on the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut my friend’s eyes were fixed upon the secretary, who stood by his\\r\\nmaster’s chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think, your Grace, that I could speak more freely in Mr. Wilder’s\\r\\nabsence.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If your Grace wishes----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, you had better go. Now, Mr. Holmes, what have you to say?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating\\r\\nsecretary.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fact is, your Grace,” said he, “that my colleague, Dr. Watson, and\\r\\nmyself had an assurance from Dr. Huxtable that a reward had been offered\\r\\nin this case. I should like to have this confirmed from your own lips.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It amounted, if I am correctly informed, to five thousand pounds to\\r\\nanyone who will tell you where your son is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who\\r\\nkeep him in custody?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Under the latter heading is included, no doubt, not only those who\\r\\nmay have taken him away, but also those who conspire to keep him in his\\r\\npresent position?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes,” cried the Duke, impatiently. “If you do your work well,\\r\\nMr. Sherlock Holmes, you will have no reason to complain of niggardly\\r\\ntreatment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of avidity\\r\\nwhich was a surprise to me, who knew his frugal tastes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancy that I see your Grace’s check-book upon the table,” said he. “I\\r\\nshould be glad if you would make me out a check for six thousand pounds.\\r\\nIt would be as well, perhaps, for you to cross it. The Capital and\\r\\nCounties Bank, Oxford Street branch are my agents.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis Grace sat very stern and upright in his chair and looked stonily at\\r\\nmy friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is this a joke, Mr. Holmes? It is hardly a subject for pleasantry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all, your Grace. I was never more earnest in my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I mean that I have earned the reward. I know where your son is, and I\\r\\nknow some, at least, of those who are holding him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke’s beard had turned more aggressively red than ever against his\\r\\nghastly white face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is he?” he gasped.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is, or was last night, at the Fighting Cock Inn, about two miles\\r\\nfrom your park gate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke fell back in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And whom do you accuse?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’s answer was an astounding one. He stepped swiftly\\r\\nforward and touched the Duke upon the shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I accuse YOU,” said he. “And now, your Grace, I’ll trouble you for that\\r\\ncheck.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNever shall I forget the Duke’s appearance as he sprang up and clawed\\r\\nwith his hands, like one who is sinking into an abyss. Then, with an\\r\\nextraordinary effort of aristocratic self-command, he sat down and sank\\r\\nhis face in his hands. It was some minutes before he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How much do you know?” he asked at last, without raising his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw you together last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does anyone else beside your friend know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have spoken to no one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his check-book.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be as good as my word, Mr. Holmes. I am about to write your\\r\\ncheck, however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be\\r\\nto me. When the offer was first made, I little thought the turn which\\r\\nevents might take. But you and your friend are men of discretion, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly understand your Grace.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must put it plainly, Mr. Holmes. If only you two know of this\\r\\nincident, there is no reason why it should go any farther. I think\\r\\ntwelve thousand pounds is the sum that I owe you, is it not?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Holmes smiled and shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear, your Grace, that matters can hardly be arranged so easily.\\r\\nThere is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But James knew nothing of that. You cannot hold him responsible for\\r\\nthat. It was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune\\r\\nto employ.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must take the view, your Grace, that when a man embarks upon a crime,\\r\\nhe is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Morally, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. But surely not in the eyes\\r\\nof the law. A man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not\\r\\npresent, and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do. The instant\\r\\nthat he heard of it he made a complete confession to me, so filled was\\r\\nhe with horror and remorse. He lost not an hour in breaking entirely\\r\\nwith the murderer. Oh, Mr. Holmes, you must save him--you must save\\r\\nhim! I tell you that you must save him!” The Duke had dropped the last\\r\\nattempt at self-command, and was pacing the room with a convulsed face\\r\\nand with his clenched hands raving in the air. At last he mastered\\r\\nhimself and sat down once more at his desk. “I appreciate your conduct\\r\\nin coming here before you spoke to anyone else,” said he. “At least, we\\r\\nmay take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly,” said Holmes. “I think, your Grace, that this can only be done\\r\\nby absolute frankness between us. I am disposed to help your Grace to\\r\\nthe best of my ability, but, in order to do so, I must understand to the\\r\\nlast detail how the matter stands. I realize that your words applied to\\r\\nMr. James Wilder, and that he is not the murderer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, the murderer has escaped.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes smiled demurely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your Grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which I\\r\\npossess, or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me. Mr.\\r\\nReuben Hayes was arrested at Chesterfield, on my information, at eleven\\r\\no’clock last night. I had a telegram from the head of the local police\\r\\nbefore I left the school this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my\\r\\nfriend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to have powers that are hardly human,” said he. “So Reuben\\r\\nHayes is taken? I am right glad to hear it, if it will not react upon\\r\\nthe fate of James.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your secretary?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, my son.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Holmes’s turn to look astonished.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess that this is entirely new to me, your Grace. I must beg you\\r\\nto be more explicit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will conceal nothing from you. I agree with you that complete\\r\\nfrankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this\\r\\ndesperate situation to which James’s folly and jealousy have reduced\\r\\nus. When I was a very young man, Mr. Holmes, I loved with such a love\\r\\nas comes only once in a lifetime. I offered the lady marriage, but she\\r\\nrefused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career. Had she\\r\\nlived, I would certainly never have married anyone else. She died, and\\r\\nleft this one child, whom for her sake I have cherished and cared for.\\r\\nI could not acknowledge the paternity to the world, but I gave him the\\r\\nbest of educations, and since he came to manhood I have kept him near\\r\\nmy person. He surmised my secret, and has presumed ever since upon the\\r\\nclaim which he has upon me, and upon his power of provoking a scandal\\r\\nwhich would be abhorrent to me. His presence had something to do\\r\\nwith the unhappy issue of my marriage. Above all, he hated my young\\r\\nlegitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred. You may well\\r\\nask me why, under these circumstances, I still kept James under my roof.\\r\\nI answer that it was because I could see his mother’s face in his, and\\r\\nthat for her dear sake there was no end to my long-suffering. All her\\r\\npretty ways too--there was not one of them which he could not suggest\\r\\nand bring back to my memory. I COULD not send him away. But I feared so\\r\\nmuch lest he should do Arthur--that is, Lord Saltire--a mischief, that I\\r\\ndispatched him for safety to Dr. Huxtable’s school.\\r\\n\\r\\n“James came into contact with this fellow Hayes, because the man was a\\r\\ntenant of mine, and James acted as agent. The fellow was a rascal from\\r\\nthe beginning, but, in some extraordinary way, James became intimate\\r\\nwith him. He had always a taste for low company. When James determined\\r\\nto kidnap Lord Saltire, it was of this man’s service that he availed\\r\\nhimself. You remember that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. Well,\\r\\nJames opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him\\r\\nin a little wood called the Ragged Shaw, which is near to the school.\\r\\nHe used the Duchess’s name, and in that way got the boy to come. That\\r\\nevening James bicycled over--I am telling you what he has himself\\r\\nconfessed to me--and he told Arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his\\r\\nmother longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and\\r\\nthat if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man\\r\\nwith a horse, who would take him to her. Poor Arthur fell into the trap.\\r\\nHe came to the appointment, and found this fellow Hayes with a led pony.\\r\\nArthur mounted, and they set off together. It appears--though this James\\r\\nonly heard yesterday--that they were pursued, that Hayes struck the\\r\\npursuer with his stick, and that the man died of his injuries. Hayes\\r\\nbrought Arthur to his public-house, the Fighting Cock, where he was\\r\\nconfined in an upper room, under the care of Mrs. Hayes, who is a kindly\\r\\nwoman, but entirely under the control of her brutal husband.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, that was the state of affairs when I first saw you\\r\\ntwo days ago. I had no more idea of the truth than you. You will ask me\\r\\nwhat was James’s motive in doing such a deed. I answer that there was\\r\\na great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in the hatred which\\r\\nhe bore my heir. In his view he should himself have been heir of all\\r\\nmy estates, and he deeply resented those social laws which made it\\r\\nimpossible. At the same time, he had a definite motive also. He was\\r\\neager that I should break the entail, and he was of opinion that it lay\\r\\nin my power to do so. He intended to make a bargain with me--to restore\\r\\nArthur if I would break the entail, and so make it possible for the\\r\\nestate to be left to him by will. He knew well that I should never\\r\\nwillingly invoke the aid of the police against him. I say that he would\\r\\nhave proposed such a bargain to me, but he did not actually do so, for\\r\\nevents moved too quickly for him, and he had not time to put his plans\\r\\ninto practice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this\\r\\nman Heidegger’s dead body. James was seized with horror at the news. It\\r\\ncame to us yesterday, as we sat together in this study. Dr. Huxtable had\\r\\nsent a telegram. James was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that\\r\\nmy suspicions, which had never been entirely absent, rose instantly to\\r\\na certainty, and I taxed him with the deed. He made a complete voluntary\\r\\nconfession. Then he implored me to keep his secret for three days\\r\\nlonger, so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his\\r\\nguilty life. I yielded--as I have always yielded--to his prayers, and\\r\\ninstantly James hurried off to the Fighting Cock to warn Hayes and\\r\\ngive him the means of flight. I could not go there by daylight without\\r\\nprovoking comment, but as soon as night fell I hurried off to see my\\r\\ndear Arthur. I found him safe and well, but horrified beyond expression\\r\\nby the dreadful deed he had witnessed. In deference to my promise, and\\r\\nmuch against my will, I consented to leave him there for three days,\\r\\nunder the charge of Mrs. Hayes, since it was evident that it was\\r\\nimpossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also\\r\\nwho was the murderer, and I could not see how that murderer could be\\r\\npunished without ruin to my unfortunate James. You asked for frankness,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, and I have taken you at your word, for I have now told you\\r\\neverything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment. Do you\\r\\nin turn be as frank with me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will,” said Holmes. “In the first place, your Grace, I am bound to\\r\\ntell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in\\r\\nthe eyes of the law. You have condoned a felony, and you have aided the\\r\\nescape of a murderer, for I cannot doubt that any money which was taken\\r\\nby James Wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your\\r\\nGrace’s purse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke bowed his assent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is, indeed, a most serious matter. Even more culpable in my\\r\\nopinion, your Grace, is your attitude towards your younger son. You\\r\\nleave him in this den for three days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Under solemn promises----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are promises to such people as these? You have no guarantee that\\r\\nhe will not be spirited away again. To humour your guilty elder son,\\r\\nyou have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary\\r\\ndanger. It was a most unjustifiable action.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proud lord of Holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated in\\r\\nhis own ducal hall. The blood flushed into his high forehead, but his\\r\\nconscience held him dumb.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will help you, but on one condition only. It is that you ring for the\\r\\nfootman and let me give such orders as I like.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout a word, the Duke pressed the electric bell. A servant entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will be glad to hear,” said Holmes, “that your young master is\\r\\nfound. It is the Duke’s desire that the carriage shall go at once to the\\r\\nFighting Cock Inn to bring Lord Saltire home.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said Holmes, when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared, “having\\r\\nsecured the future, we can afford to be more lenient with the past. I am\\r\\nnot in an official position, and there is no reason, so long as the\\r\\nends of justice are served, why I should disclose all that I know. As to\\r\\nHayes, I say nothing. The gallows awaits him, and I would do nothing\\r\\nto save him from it. What he will divulge I cannot tell, but I have\\r\\nno doubt that your Grace could make him understand that it is to his\\r\\ninterest to be silent. From the police point of view he will have\\r\\nkidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom. If they do not themselves\\r\\nfind it out, I see no reason why I should prompt them to take a broader\\r\\npoint of view. I would warn your Grace, however, that the continued\\r\\npresence of Mr. James Wilder in your household can only lead to\\r\\nmisfortune.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand that, Mr. Holmes, and it is already settled that he shall\\r\\nleave me forever, and go to seek his fortune in Australia.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case, your Grace, since you have yourself stated that any\\r\\nunhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence I would\\r\\nsuggest that you make such amends as you can to the Duchess, and\\r\\nthat you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily\\r\\ninterrupted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That also I have arranged, Mr. Holmes. I wrote to the Duchess this\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case,” said Holmes, rising, “I think that my friend and I can\\r\\ncongratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little\\r\\nvisit to the North. There is one other small point upon which I desire\\r\\nsome light. This fellow Hayes had shod his horses with shoes which\\r\\ncounterfeited the tracks of cows. Was it from Mr. Wilder that he learned\\r\\nso extraordinary a device?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Duke stood in thought for a moment, with a look of intense surprise\\r\\non his face. Then he opened a door and showed us into a large room\\r\\nfurnished as a museum. He led the way to a glass case in a corner, and\\r\\npointed to the inscription.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These shoes,” it ran, “were dug up in the moat of Holdernesse Hall.\\r\\nThey are for the use of horses, but they are shaped below with a cloven\\r\\nfoot of iron, so as to throw pursuers off the track. They are supposed\\r\\nto have belonged to some of the marauding Barons of Holdernesse in the\\r\\nMiddle Ages.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes opened the case, and moistening his finger he passed it along the\\r\\nshoe. A thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said he, as he replaced the glass. “It is the second most\\r\\ninteresting object that I have seen in the North.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the first?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes folded up his check and placed it carefully in his notebook. “I\\r\\nam a poor man,” said he, as he patted it affectionately, and thrust it\\r\\ninto the depths of his inner pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF BLACK PETER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never known my friend to be in better form, both mental and\\r\\nphysical, than in the year ‘95. His increasing fame had brought with it\\r\\nan immense practice, and I should be guilty of an indiscretion if I\\r\\nwere even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who\\r\\ncrossed our humble threshold in Baker Street. Holmes, however, like all\\r\\ngreat artists, lived for his art’s sake, and, save in the case of the\\r\\nDuke of Holdernesse, I have seldom known him claim any large reward for\\r\\nhis inestimable services. So unworldly was he--or so capricious--that\\r\\nhe frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the\\r\\nproblem made no appeal to his sympathies, while he would devote weeks of\\r\\nmost intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case\\r\\npresented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his\\r\\nimagination and challenged his ingenuity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this memorable year ‘95, a curious and incongruous succession of\\r\\ncases had engaged his attention, ranging from his famous investigation\\r\\nof the sudden death of Cardinal Tosca--an inquiry which was carried\\r\\nout by him at the express desire of His Holiness the Pope--down to\\r\\nhis arrest of Wilson, the notorious canary-trainer, which removed a\\r\\nplague-spot from the East End of London. Close on the heels of these\\r\\ntwo famous cases came the tragedy of Woodman’s Lee, and the very obscure\\r\\ncircumstances which surrounded the death of Captain Peter Carey. No\\r\\nrecord of the doings of Mr. Sherlock Holmes would be complete which did\\r\\nnot include some account of this very unusual affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first week of July, my friend had been absent so often and\\r\\nso long from our lodgings that I knew he had something on hand. The fact\\r\\nthat several rough-looking men called during that time and inquired for\\r\\nCaptain Basil made me understand that Holmes was working somewhere under\\r\\none of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own\\r\\nformidable identity. He had at least five small refuges in different\\r\\nparts of London, in which he was able to change his personality. He\\r\\nsaid nothing of his business to me, and it was not my habit to force a\\r\\nconfidence. The first positive sign which he gave me of the direction\\r\\nwhich his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one. He had gone\\r\\nout before breakfast, and I had sat down to mine when he strode into the\\r\\nroom, his hat upon his head and a huge barbed-headed spear tucked like\\r\\nan umbrella under his arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good gracious, Holmes!” I cried. “You don’t mean to say that you have\\r\\nbeen walking about London with that thing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I drove to the butcher’s and back.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The butcher’s?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I return with an excellent appetite. There can be no question,\\r\\nmy dear Watson, of the value of exercise before breakfast. But I am\\r\\nprepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has\\r\\ntaken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not attempt it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe chuckled as he poured out the coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you could have looked into Allardyce’s back shop, you would have\\r\\nseen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in\\r\\nhis shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon. I was that\\r\\nenergetic person, and I have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my\\r\\nstrength can I transfix the pig with a single blow. Perhaps you would\\r\\ncare to try?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not for worlds. But why were you doing this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of\\r\\nWoodman’s Lee. Ah, Hopkins, I got your wire last night, and I have been\\r\\nexpecting you. Come and join us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor was an exceedingly alert man, thirty years of age, dressed\\r\\nin a quiet tweed suit, but retaining the erect bearing of one who was\\r\\naccustomed to official uniform. I recognized him at once as Stanley\\r\\nHopkins, a young police inspector, for whose future Holmes had high\\r\\nhopes, while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil\\r\\nfor the scientific methods of the famous amateur. Hopkins’s brow was\\r\\nclouded, and he sat down with an air of deep dejection.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, thank you, sir. I breakfasted before I came round. I spent the\\r\\nnight in town, for I came up yesterday to report.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what had you to report?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Failure, sir, absolute failure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have made no progress?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“None.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me! I must have a look at the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish to heavens that you would, Mr. Holmes. It’s my first big chance,\\r\\nand I am at my wit’s end. For goodness’ sake, come down and lend me a\\r\\nhand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, it just happens that I have already read all the available\\r\\nevidence, including the report of the inquest, with some care. By the\\r\\nway, what do you make of that tobacco pouch, found on the scene of the\\r\\ncrime? Is there no clue there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHopkins looked surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was the man’s own pouch, sir. His initials were inside it. And it\\r\\nwas of sealskin,--and he was an old sealer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he had no pipe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, we could find no pipe. Indeed, he smoked very little, and yet\\r\\nhe might have kept some tobacco for his friends.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt. I only mention it because, if I had been handling the case,\\r\\nI should have been inclined to make that the starting-point of my\\r\\ninvestigation. However, my friend, Dr. Watson, knows nothing of this\\r\\nmatter, and I should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of\\r\\nevents once more. Just give us some short sketches of the essentials.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man,\\r\\nCaptain Peter Carey. He was born in ‘45--fifty years of age. He was a\\r\\nmost daring and successful seal and whale fisher. In 1883 he commanded\\r\\nthe steam sealer SEA UNICORN, of Dundee. He had then had several\\r\\nsuccessful voyages in succession, and in the following year, 1884, he\\r\\nretired. After that he travelled for some years, and finally he bought\\r\\na small place called Woodman’s Lee, near Forest Row, in Sussex. There he\\r\\nhas lived for six years, and there he died just a week ago to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There were some most singular points about the man. In ordinary\\r\\nlife, he was a strict Puritan--a silent, gloomy fellow. His household\\r\\nconsisted of his wife, his daughter, aged twenty, and two female\\r\\nservants. These last were continually changing, for it was never a very\\r\\ncheery situation, and sometimes it became past all bearing. The man\\r\\nwas an intermittent drunkard, and when he had the fit on him he was a\\r\\nperfect fiend. He has been known to drive his wife and daughter out of\\r\\ndoors in the middle of the night and flog them through the park until\\r\\nthe whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar, who had\\r\\ncalled upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct. In short,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than\\r\\nPeter Carey, and I have heard that he bore the same character when he\\r\\ncommanded his ship. He was known in the trade as Black Peter, and the\\r\\nname was given him, not only on account of his swarthy features and the\\r\\ncolour of his huge beard, but for the humours which were the terror of\\r\\nall around him. I need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every\\r\\none of his neighbours, and that I have not heard one single word of\\r\\nsorrow about his terrible end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must have read in the account of the inquest about the man’s cabin,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it. He had\\r\\nbuilt himself a wooden outhouse--he always called it the ‘cabin’--a few\\r\\nhundred yards from his house, and it was here that he slept every night.\\r\\nIt was a little, single-roomed hut, sixteen feet by ten. He kept the\\r\\nkey in his pocket, made his own bed, cleaned it himself, and allowed no\\r\\nother foot to cross the threshold. There are small windows on each side,\\r\\nwhich were covered by curtains and never opened. One of these windows\\r\\nwas turned towards the high road, and when the light burned in it at\\r\\nnight the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what Black\\r\\nPeter was doing in there. That’s the window, Mr. Holmes, which gave us\\r\\none of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You remember that a stonemason, named Slater, walking from Forest Row\\r\\nabout one o’clock in the morning--two days before the murder--stopped\\r\\nas he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining\\r\\namong the trees. He swears that the shadow of a man’s head turned\\r\\nsideways was clearly visible on the blind, and that this shadow was\\r\\ncertainly not that of Peter Carey, whom he knew well. It was that of a\\r\\nbearded man, but the beard was short and bristled forward in a way very\\r\\ndifferent from that of the captain. So he says, but he had been two\\r\\nhours in the public-house, and it is some distance from the road to the\\r\\nwindow. Besides, this refers to the Monday, and the crime was done upon\\r\\nthe Wednesday.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the Tuesday, Peter Carey was in one of his blackest moods, flushed\\r\\nwith drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast. He roamed about the\\r\\nhouse, and the women ran for it when they heard him coming. Late in the\\r\\nevening, he went down to his own hut. About two o’clock the following\\r\\nmorning, his daughter, who slept with her window open, heard a most\\r\\nfearful yell from that direction, but it was no unusual thing for him to\\r\\nbawl and shout when he was in drink, so no notice was taken. On rising\\r\\nat seven, one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open,\\r\\nbut so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday\\r\\nbefore anyone would venture down to see what had become of him. Peeping\\r\\ninto the open door, they saw a sight which sent them flying, with white\\r\\nfaces, into the village. Within an hour, I was on the spot and had taken\\r\\nover the case.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have fairly steady nerves, as you know, Mr. Holmes, but I give\\r\\nyou my word, that I got a shake when I put my head into that little\\r\\nhouse. It was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles,\\r\\nand the floor and walls were like a slaughter-house. He had called it a\\r\\ncabin, and a cabin it was, sure enough, for you would have thought that\\r\\nyou were in a ship. There was a bunk at one end, a sea-chest, maps and\\r\\ncharts, a picture of the SEA UNICORN, a line of logbooks on a shelf, all\\r\\nexactly as one would expect to find it in a captain’s room. And there,\\r\\nin the middle of it, was the man himself--his face twisted like a lost\\r\\nsoul in torment, and his great brindled beard stuck upward in his agony.\\r\\nRight through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven, and it\\r\\nhad sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him. He was pinned like a\\r\\nbeetle on a card. Of course, he was quite dead, and had been so from the\\r\\ninstant that he had uttered that last yell of agony.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know your methods, sir, and I applied them. Before I permitted\\r\\nanything to be moved, I examined most carefully the ground outside, and\\r\\nalso the floor of the room. There were no footmarks.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Meaning that you saw none?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I assure you, sir, that there were none.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My good Hopkins, I have investigated many crimes, but I have never\\r\\nyet seen one which was committed by a flying creature. As long as the\\r\\ncriminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation,\\r\\nsome abrasion, some trifling displacement which can be detected by the\\r\\nscientific searcher. It is incredible that this blood-bespattered room\\r\\ncontained no trace which could have aided us. I understand, however,\\r\\nfrom the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to\\r\\noverlook?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young inspector winced at my companion’s ironical comments.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was a fool not to call you in at the time Mr. Holmes. However, that’s\\r\\npast praying for now. Yes, there were several objects in the room which\\r\\ncalled for special attention. One was the harpoon with which the deed\\r\\nwas committed. It had been snatched down from a rack on the wall. Two\\r\\nothers remained there, and there was a vacant place for the third.\\r\\nOn the stock was engraved ‘SS. SEA UNICORN, Dundee.’ This seemed to\\r\\nestablish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury, and that\\r\\nthe murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way. The fact\\r\\nthat the crime was committed at two in the morning, and yet Peter\\r\\nCarey was fully dressed, suggested that he had an appointment with the\\r\\nmurderer, which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two\\r\\ndirty glasses stood upon the table.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “I think that both inferences are permissible. Was\\r\\nthere any other spirit but rum in the room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the\\r\\nsea-chest. It is of no importance to us, however, since the decanters\\r\\nwere full, and it had therefore not been used.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For all that, its presence has some significance,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“However, let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you\\r\\nto bear upon the case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was this tobacco-pouch upon the table.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What part of the table?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It lay in the middle. It was of coarse sealskin--the straight-haired\\r\\nskin, with a leather thong to bind it. Inside was ‘P.C.’ on the flap.\\r\\nThere was half an ounce of strong ship’s tobacco in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! What more?”\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins drew from his pocket a drab-covered notebook. The\\r\\noutside was rough and worn, the leaves discoloured. On the first page\\r\\nwere written the initials “J.H.N.” and the date “1883.” Holmes laid\\r\\nit on the table and examined it in his minute way, while Hopkins and I\\r\\ngazed over each shoulder. On the second page were the printed letters\\r\\n“C.P.R.,” and then came several sheets of numbers. Another heading was\\r\\n“Argentine,” another “Costa Rica,” and another “San Paulo,” each with\\r\\npages of signs and figures after it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you make of these?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They appear to be lists of Stock Exchange securities. I thought that\\r\\n‘J.H.N.’ were the initials of a broker, and that ‘C.P.R.’ may have been\\r\\nhis client.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Try Canadian Pacific Railway,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins swore between his teeth, and struck his thigh with his\\r\\nclenched hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a fool I have been!” he cried. “Of course, it is as you say. Then\\r\\n‘J.H.N.’ are the only initials we have to solve. I have already examined\\r\\nthe old Stock Exchange lists, and I can find no one in 1883, either in\\r\\nthe house or among the outside brokers, whose initials correspond with\\r\\nthese. Yet I feel that the clue is the most important one that I hold.\\r\\nYou will admit, Mr. Holmes, that there is a possibility that these\\r\\ninitials are those of the second person who was present--in other words,\\r\\nof the murderer. I would also urge that the introduction into the case\\r\\nof a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us\\r\\nfor the first time some indication of a motive for the crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this\\r\\nnew development.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must admit both your points,” said he. “I confess that this notebook,\\r\\nwhich did not appear at the inquest, modifies any views which I may have\\r\\nformed. I had come to a theory of the crime in which I can find no\\r\\nplace for this. Have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here\\r\\nmentioned?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Inquiries are now being made at the offices, but I fear that the\\r\\ncomplete register of the stockholders of these South American concerns\\r\\nis in South America, and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace\\r\\nthe shares.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying\\r\\nlens.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely there is some discolouration here,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, it is a blood-stain. I told you that I picked the book off\\r\\nthe floor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the blood-stain above or below?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On the side next the boards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which proves, of course, that the book was dropped after the crime was\\r\\ncommitted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly, Mr. Holmes. I appreciated that point, and I conjectured that\\r\\nit was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight. It lay near the\\r\\ndoor.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose that none of these securities have been found among the\\r\\nproperty of the dead man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you any reason to suspect robbery?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir. Nothing seemed to have been touched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, it is certainly a very interesting case. Then there was a\\r\\nknife, was there not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A sheath-knife, still in its sheath. It lay at the feet of the dead\\r\\nman. Mrs. Carey has identified it as being her husband’s property.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was lost in thought for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said he, at last, “I suppose I shall have to come out and have a\\r\\nlook at it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins gave a cry of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, sir. That will, indeed, be a weight off my mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his finger at the inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It would have been an easier task a week ago,” said he. “But even now\\r\\nmy visit may not be entirely fruitless. Watson, if you can spare\\r\\nthe time, I should be very glad of your company. If you will call a\\r\\nfour-wheeler, Hopkins, we shall be ready to start for Forest Row in a\\r\\nquarter of an hour.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAlighting at the small wayside station, we drove for some miles through\\r\\nthe remains of widespread woods, which were once part of that\\r\\ngreat forest which for so long held the Saxon invaders at bay--the\\r\\nimpenetrable “weald,” for sixty years the bulwark of Britain. Vast\\r\\nsections of it have been cleared, for this is the seat of the first\\r\\niron-works of the country, and the trees have been felled to smelt the\\r\\nore. Now the richer fields of the North have absorbed the trade, and\\r\\nnothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the\\r\\nwork of the past. Here, in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill,\\r\\nstood a long, low, stone house, approached by a curving drive running\\r\\nthrough the fields. Nearer the road, and surrounded on three sides by\\r\\nbushes, was a small outhouse, one window and the door facing in our\\r\\ndirection. It was the scene of the murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins led us first to the house, where he introduced us to a\\r\\nhaggard, gray-haired woman, the widow of the murdered man, whose gaunt\\r\\nand deep-lined face, with the furtive look of terror in the depths of\\r\\nher red-rimmed eyes, told of the years of hardship and ill-usage which\\r\\nshe had endured. With her was her daughter, a pale, fair-haired girl,\\r\\nwhose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that\\r\\nher father was dead, and that she blessed the hand which had struck him\\r\\ndown. It was a terrible household that Black Peter Carey had made for\\r\\nhimself, and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in\\r\\nthe sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn\\r\\nacross the fields by the feet of the dead man.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe outhouse was the simplest of dwellings, wooden-walled,\\r\\nshingle-roofed, one window beside the door and one on the farther side.\\r\\nStanley Hopkins drew the key from his pocket and had stooped to the\\r\\nlock, when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his\\r\\nface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone has been tampering with it,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could be no doubt of the fact. The woodwork was cut, and the\\r\\nscratches showed white through the paint, as if they had been that\\r\\ninstant done. Holmes had been examining the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone has tried to force this also. Whoever it was has failed to make\\r\\nhis way in. He must have been a very poor burglar.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is a most extraordinary thing,” said the inspector, “I could swear\\r\\nthat these marks were not here yesterday evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Some curious person from the village, perhaps,” I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very unlikely. Few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds, far\\r\\nless try to force their way into the cabin. What do you think of it, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think that fortune is very kind to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean that the person will come again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very probable. He came expecting to find the door open. He tried\\r\\nto get in with the blade of a very small penknife. He could not manage\\r\\nit. What would he do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come again next night with a more useful tool.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I should say. It will be our fault if we are not there to receive\\r\\nhim. Meanwhile, let me see the inside of the cabin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe traces of the tragedy had been removed, but the furniture within the\\r\\nlittle room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime. For\\r\\ntwo hours, with most intense concentration, Holmes examined every object\\r\\nin turn, but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one.\\r\\nOnce only he paused in his patient investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you taken anything off this shelf, Hopkins?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have moved nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Something has been taken. There is less dust in this corner of the\\r\\nshelf than elsewhere. It may have been a book lying on its side. It may\\r\\nhave been a box. Well, well, I can do nothing more. Let us walk in\\r\\nthese beautiful woods, Watson, and give a few hours to the birds and the\\r\\nflowers. We shall meet you here later, Hopkins, and see if we can come\\r\\nto closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the\\r\\nnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was past eleven o’clock when we formed our little ambuscade. Hopkins\\r\\nwas for leaving the door of the hut open, but Holmes was of the opinion\\r\\nthat this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger. The lock was a\\r\\nperfectly simple one, and only a strong blade was needed to push it\\r\\nback. Holmes also suggested that we should wait, not inside the hut,\\r\\nbut outside it, among the bushes which grew round the farther window.\\r\\nIn this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light, and\\r\\nsee what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a long and melancholy vigil, and yet brought with it something\\r\\nof the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water-pool,\\r\\nand waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey. What savage\\r\\ncreature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness? Was it\\r\\na fierce tiger of crime, which could only be taken fighting hard with\\r\\nflashing fang and claw, or would it prove to be some skulking jackal,\\r\\ndangerous only to the weak and unguarded?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes, waiting for whatever\\r\\nmight come. At first the steps of a few belated villagers, or the sound\\r\\nof voices from the village, lightened our vigil, but one by one these\\r\\ninterruptions died away, and an absolute stillness fell upon us, save\\r\\nfor the chimes of the distant church, which told us of the progress of\\r\\nthe night, and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid\\r\\nthe foliage which roofed us in.\\r\\n\\r\\nHalf-past two had chimed, and it was the darkest hour which precedes\\r\\nthe dawn, when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the\\r\\ndirection of the gate. Someone had entered the drive. Again there was a\\r\\nlong silence, and I had begun to fear that it was a false alarm, when\\r\\na stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut, and a moment\\r\\nlater a metallic scraping and clinking. The man was trying to force the\\r\\nlock. This time his skill was greater or his tool was better, for there\\r\\nwas a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges. Then a match was struck,\\r\\nand next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of\\r\\nthe hut. Through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the\\r\\nscene within.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe nocturnal visitor was a young man, frail and thin, with a black\\r\\nmoustache, which intensified the deadly pallor of his face. He could not\\r\\nhave been much above twenty years of age. I have never seen any human\\r\\nbeing who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright, for his teeth were\\r\\nvisibly chattering, and he was shaking in every limb. He was dressed\\r\\nlike a gentleman, in Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, with a cloth cap\\r\\nupon his head. We watched him staring round with frightened eyes. Then\\r\\nhe laid the candle-end upon the table and disappeared from our view into\\r\\none of the corners. He returned with a large book, one of the logbooks\\r\\nwhich formed a line upon the shelves. Leaning on the table, he rapidly\\r\\nturned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which\\r\\nhe sought. Then, with an angry gesture of his clenched hand, he closed\\r\\nthe book, replaced it in the corner, and put out the light. He had\\r\\nhardly turned to leave the hut when Hopkin’s hand was on the fellow’s\\r\\ncollar, and I heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he\\r\\nwas taken. The candle was relit, and there was our wretched captive,\\r\\nshivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective. He sank down upon\\r\\nthe sea-chest, and looked helplessly from one of us to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, my fine fellow,” said Stanley Hopkins, “who are you, and what do\\r\\nyou want here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man pulled himself together, and faced us with an effort at\\r\\nself-composure.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are detectives, I suppose?” said he. “You imagine I am connected\\r\\nwith the death of Captain Peter Carey. I assure you that I am innocent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’ll see about that,” said Hopkins. “First of all, what is your name?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is John Hopley Neligan.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw Holmes and Hopkins exchange a quick glance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are you doing here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I speak confidentially?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should I tell you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you have no answer, it may go badly with you at the trial.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young man winced.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I will tell you,” he said. “Why should I not? And yet I hate to\\r\\nthink of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life. Did you ever hear\\r\\nof Dawson and Neligan?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see, from Hopkins’s face, that he never had, but Holmes was\\r\\nkeenly interested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean the West Country bankers,” said he. “They failed for a\\r\\nmillion, ruined half the county families of Cornwall, and Neligan\\r\\ndisappeared.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. Neligan was my father.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we were getting something positive, and yet it seemed a long gap\\r\\nbetween an absconding banker and Captain Peter Carey pinned against the\\r\\nwall with one of his own harpoons. We all listened intently to the young\\r\\nman’s words.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was my father who was really concerned. Dawson had retired. I was\\r\\nonly ten years of age at the time, but I was old enough to feel the\\r\\nshame and horror of it all. It has always been said that my father stole\\r\\nall the securities and fled. It is not true. It was his belief that if\\r\\nhe were given time in which to realize them, all would be well and every\\r\\ncreditor paid in full. He started in his little yacht for Norway just\\r\\nbefore the warrant was issued for his arrest. I can remember that last\\r\\nnight when he bade farewell to my mother. He left us a list of the\\r\\nsecurities he was taking, and he swore that he would come back with his\\r\\nhonour cleared, and that none who had trusted him would suffer. Well,\\r\\nno word was ever heard from him again. Both the yacht and he vanished\\r\\nutterly. We believed, my mother and I, that he and it, with the\\r\\nsecurities that he had taken with him, were at the bottom of the sea. We\\r\\nhad a faithful friend, however, who is a business man, and it was he who\\r\\ndiscovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father\\r\\nhad with him had reappeared on the London market. You can imagine our\\r\\namazement. I spent months in trying to trace them, and at last, after\\r\\nmany doubtings and difficulties, I discovered that the original seller\\r\\nhad been Captain Peter Carey, the owner of this hut.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Naturally, I made some inquiries about the man. I found that he had\\r\\nbeen in command of a whaler which was due to return from the Arctic seas\\r\\nat the very time when my father was crossing to Norway. The autumn of\\r\\nthat year was a stormy one, and there was a long succession of southerly\\r\\ngales. My father’s yacht may well have been blown to the north, and\\r\\nthere met by Captain Peter Carey’s ship. If that were so, what had\\r\\nbecome of my father? In any case, if I could prove from Peter Carey’s\\r\\nevidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof\\r\\nthat my father had not sold them, and that he had no view to personal\\r\\nprofit when he took them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I came down to Sussex with the intention of seeing the captain, but\\r\\nit was at this moment that his terrible death occurred. I read at the\\r\\ninquest a description of his cabin, in which it stated that the old\\r\\nlogbooks of his vessel were preserved in it. It struck me that if I\\r\\ncould see what occurred in the month of August, 1883, on board the SEA\\r\\nUNICORN, I might settle the mystery of my father’s fate. I tried\\r\\nlast night to get at these logbooks, but was unable to open the door.\\r\\nTo-night I tried again and succeeded, but I find that the pages which\\r\\ndeal with that month have been torn from the book. It was at that moment\\r\\nI found myself a prisoner in your hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that all?” asked Hopkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, that is all.” His eyes shifted as he said it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have nothing else to tell us?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, there is nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have not been here before last night?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how do you account for THAT?” cried Hopkins, as he held up the\\r\\ndamning notebook, with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf\\r\\nand the blood-stain on the cover.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wretched man collapsed. He sank his face in his hands, and trembled\\r\\nall over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get it?” he groaned. “I did not know. I thought I had\\r\\nlost it at the hotel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is enough,” said Hopkins, sternly. “Whatever else you have to\\r\\nsay, you must say in court. You will walk down with me now to the\\r\\npolice-station. Well, Mr. Holmes, I am very much obliged to you and to\\r\\nyour friend for coming down to help me. As it turns out your presence\\r\\nwas unnecessary, and I would have brought the case to this successful\\r\\nissue without you, but, none the less, I am grateful. Rooms have been\\r\\nreserved for you at the Brambletye Hotel, so we can all walk down to the\\r\\nvillage together.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson, what do you think of it?” asked Holmes, as we travelled\\r\\nback next morning.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can see that you are not satisfied.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, my dear Watson, I am perfectly satisfied. At the same\\r\\ntime, Stanley Hopkins’s methods do not commend themselves to me. I am\\r\\ndisappointed in Stanley Hopkins. I had hoped for better things from him.\\r\\nOne should always look for a possible alternative, and provide against\\r\\nit. It is the first rule of criminal investigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, then, is the alternative?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The line of investigation which I have myself been pursuing. It may\\r\\ngive us nothing. I cannot tell. But at least I shall follow it to the\\r\\nend.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral letters were waiting for Holmes at Baker Street. He snatched\\r\\none of them up, opened it, and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of\\r\\nlaughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent, Watson! The alternative develops. Have you telegraph\\r\\nforms? Just write a couple of messages for me: ‘Sumner, Shipping\\r\\nAgent, Ratcliff Highway. Send three men on, to arrive ten to-morrow\\r\\nmorning.--Basil.’ That’s my name in those parts. The other is:\\r\\n‘Inspector Stanley Hopkins, 46 Lord Street, Brixton. Come breakfast\\r\\nto-morrow at nine-thirty. Important. Wire if unable to come.--Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes.’ There, Watson, this infernal case has haunted me for ten days.\\r\\nI hereby banish it completely from my presence. To-morrow, I trust that\\r\\nwe shall hear the last of it forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSharp at the hour named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared, and we sat\\r\\ndown together to the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared.\\r\\nThe young detective was in high spirits at his success.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You really think that your solution must be correct?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not imagine a more complete case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It did not seem to me conclusive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You astonish me, Mr. Holmes. What more could one ask for?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does your explanation cover every point?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly. I find that young Neligan arrived at the Brambletye Hotel\\r\\non the very day of the crime. He came on the pretence of playing golf.\\r\\nHis room was on the ground-floor, and he could get out when he liked.\\r\\nThat very night he went down to Woodman’s Lee, saw Peter Carey at\\r\\nthe hut, quarrelled with him, and killed him with the harpoon. Then,\\r\\nhorrified by what he had done, he fled out of the hut, dropping the\\r\\nnotebook which he had brought with him in order to question Peter Carey\\r\\nabout these different securities. You may have observed that some of\\r\\nthem were marked with ticks, and the others--the great majority--were\\r\\nnot. Those which are ticked have been traced on the London market, but\\r\\nthe others, presumably, were still in the possession of Carey, and young\\r\\nNeligan, according to his own account, was anxious to recover them in\\r\\norder to do the right thing by his father’s creditors. After his flight\\r\\nhe did not dare to approach the hut again for some time, but at last\\r\\nhe forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he\\r\\nneeded. Surely that is all simple and obvious?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled and shook his head. “It seems to me to have only one\\r\\ndrawback, Hopkins, and that is that it is intrinsically impossible. Have\\r\\nyou tried to drive a harpoon through a body? No? Tut, tut my dear sir,\\r\\nyou must really pay attention to these details. My friend Watson could\\r\\ntell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise. It is no easy\\r\\nmatter, and requires a strong and practised arm. But this blow was\\r\\ndelivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep\\r\\ninto the wall. Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so\\r\\nfrightful an assault? Is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with\\r\\nBlack Peter in the dead of the night? Was it his profile that was seen\\r\\non the blind two nights before? No, no, Hopkins, it is another and more\\r\\nformidable person for whom we must seek.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective’s face had grown longer and longer during Holmes’s speech.\\r\\nHis hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him. But he would\\r\\nnot abandon his position without a struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t deny that Neligan was present that night, Mr. Holmes. The\\r\\nbook will prove that. I fancy that I have evidence enough to satisfy a\\r\\njury, even if you are able to pick a hole in it. Besides, Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nI have laid my hand upon MY man. As to this terrible person of yours,\\r\\nwhere is he?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I rather fancy that he is on the stair,” said Holmes, serenely. “I\\r\\nthink, Watson, that you would do well to put that revolver where you can\\r\\nreach it.” He rose and laid a written paper upon a side-table. “Now we\\r\\nare ready,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere had been some talking in gruff voices outside, and now Mrs. Hudson\\r\\nopened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for Captain\\r\\nBasil.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Show them in one by one,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first who entered was a little Ribston pippin of a man, with ruddy\\r\\ncheeks and fluffy white side-whiskers. Holmes had drawn a letter from\\r\\nhis pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What name?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“James Lancaster.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry, Lancaster, but the berth is full. Here is half a sovereign\\r\\nfor your trouble. Just step into this room and wait there for a few\\r\\nminutes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second man was a long, dried-up creature, with lank hair and sallow\\r\\ncheeks. His name was Hugh Pattins. He also received his dismissal, his\\r\\nhalf-sovereign, and the order to wait.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance. A fierce\\r\\nbull-dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard, and two bold,\\r\\ndark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick, tufted, overhung eyebrows.\\r\\nHe saluted and stood sailor-fashion, turning his cap round in his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your name?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Patrick Cairns.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Harpooner?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. Twenty-six voyages.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dundee, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And ready to start with an exploring ship?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What wages?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Eight pounds a month.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could you start at once?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As soon as I get my kit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you your papers?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.” He took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket.\\r\\nHolmes glanced over them and returned them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are just the man I want,” said he. “Here’s the agreement on the\\r\\nside-table. If you sign it the whole matter will be settled.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I sign here?” he asked, stooping over the table.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This will do,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nI heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull. The next\\r\\ninstant Holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together. He\\r\\nwas a man of such gigantic strength that, even with the handcuffs\\r\\nwhich Holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists, he would have\\r\\nvery quickly overpowered my friend had Hopkins and I not rushed to\\r\\nhis rescue. Only when I pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his\\r\\ntemple did he at last understand that resistance was vain. We lashed his\\r\\nankles with cord, and rose breathless from the struggle.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must really apologize, Hopkins,” said Sherlock Holmes. “I fear that\\r\\nthe scrambled eggs are cold. However, you will enjoy the rest of your\\r\\nbreakfast all the better, will you not, for the thought that you have\\r\\nbrought your case to a triumphant conclusion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins was speechless with amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know what to say, Mr. Holmes,” he blurted out at last, with a\\r\\nvery red face. “It seems to me that I have been making a fool of\\r\\nmyself from the beginning. I understand now, what I should never have\\r\\nforgotten, that I am the pupil and you are the master. Even now I\\r\\nsee what you have done, but I don’t know how you did it or what it\\r\\nsignifies.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well,” said Holmes, good-humouredly. “We all learn by experience,\\r\\nand your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the\\r\\nalternative. You were so absorbed in young Neligan that you could not\\r\\nspare a thought to Patrick Cairns, the true murderer of Peter Carey.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“See here, mister,” said he, “I make no complaint of being man-handled\\r\\nin this fashion, but I would have you call things by their right names.\\r\\nYou say I murdered Peter Carey, I say I KILLED Peter Carey, and there’s\\r\\nall the difference. Maybe you don’t believe what I say. Maybe you think\\r\\nI am just slinging you a yarn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all,” said Holmes. “Let us hear what you have to say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s soon told, and, by the Lord, every word of it is truth. I knew\\r\\nBlack Peter, and when he pulled out his knife I whipped a harpoon\\r\\nthrough him sharp, for I knew that it was him or me. That’s how he died.\\r\\nYou can call it murder. Anyhow, I’d as soon die with a rope round my\\r\\nneck as with Black Peter’s knife in my heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How came you there?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell it you from the beginning. Just sit me up a little, so as\\r\\nI can speak easy. It was in ‘83 that it happened--August of that year.\\r\\nPeter Carey was master of the SEA UNICORN, and I was spare harpooner. We\\r\\nwere coming out of the ice-pack on our way home, with head winds and a\\r\\nweek’s southerly gale, when we picked up a little craft that had been\\r\\nblown north. There was one man on her--a landsman. The crew had thought\\r\\nshe would founder and had made for the Norwegian coast in the dinghy. I\\r\\nguess they were all drowned. Well, we took him on board, this man, and\\r\\nhe and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin. All the baggage we\\r\\ntook off with him was one tin box. So far as I know, the man’s name was\\r\\nnever mentioned, and on the second night he disappeared as if he had\\r\\nnever been. It was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard\\r\\nor fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having. Only one\\r\\nman knew what had happened to him, and that was me, for, with my own\\r\\neyes, I saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail\\r\\nin the middle watch of a dark night, two days before we sighted the\\r\\nShetland Lights. Well, I kept my knowledge to myself, and waited to see\\r\\nwhat would come of it. When we got back to Scotland it was easily hushed\\r\\nup, and nobody asked any questions. A stranger died by accident and it\\r\\nwas nobody’s business to inquire. Shortly after Peter Carey gave up the\\r\\nsea, and it was long years before I could find where he was. I guessed\\r\\nthat he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box, and\\r\\nthat he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut. I\\r\\nfound out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in London,\\r\\nand down I went to squeeze him. The first night he was reasonable\\r\\nenough, and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for\\r\\nlife. We were to fix it all two nights later. When I came, I found him\\r\\nthree parts drunk and in a vile temper. We sat down and we drank and we\\r\\nyarned about old times, but the more he drank the less I liked the look\\r\\non his face. I spotted that harpoon upon the wall, and I thought I might\\r\\nneed it before I was through. Then at last he broke out at me, spitting\\r\\nand cursing, with murder in his eyes and a great clasp-knife in his\\r\\nhand. He had not time to get it from the sheath before I had the harpoon\\r\\nthrough him. Heavens! what a yell he gave! and his face gets between me\\r\\nand my sleep. I stood there, with his blood splashing round me, and I\\r\\nwaited for a bit, but all was quiet, so I took heart once more. I looked\\r\\nround, and there was the tin box on the shelf. I had as much right to\\r\\nit as Peter Carey, anyhow, so I took it with me and left the hut. Like a\\r\\nfool I left my baccy-pouch upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I’ll tell you the queerest part of the whole story. I had hardly\\r\\ngot outside the hut when I heard someone coming, and I hid among the\\r\\nbushes. A man came slinking along, went into the hut, gave a cry as if\\r\\nhe had seen a ghost, and legged it as hard as he could run until he was\\r\\nout of sight. Who he was or what he wanted is more than I can tell.\\r\\nFor my part I walked ten miles, got a train at Tunbridge Wells, and so\\r\\nreached London, and no one the wiser.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when I came to examine the box I found there was no money in it,\\r\\nand nothing but papers that I would not dare to sell. I had lost my hold\\r\\non Black Peter and was stranded in London without a shilling. There was\\r\\nonly my trade left. I saw these advertisements about harpooners, and\\r\\nhigh wages, so I went to the shipping agents, and they sent me here.\\r\\nThat’s all I know, and I say again that if I killed Black Peter, the law\\r\\nshould give me thanks, for I saved them the price of a hempen rope.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A very clear statement said Holmes,” rising and lighting his pipe. “I\\r\\nthink, Hopkins, that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner\\r\\nto a place of safety. This room is not well adapted for a cell, and Mr.\\r\\nPatrick Cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes,” said Hopkins, “I do not know how to express my gratitude.\\r\\nEven now I do not understand how you attained this result.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the\\r\\nbeginning. It is very possible if I had known about this notebook\\r\\nit might have led away my thoughts, as it did yours. But all I heard\\r\\npointed in the one direction. The amazing strength, the skill in the use\\r\\nof the harpoon, the rum and water, the sealskin tobacco-pouch with the\\r\\ncoarse tobacco--all these pointed to a seaman, and one who had been a\\r\\nwhaler. I was convinced that the initials ‘P.C.’ upon the pouch were a\\r\\ncoincidence, and not those of Peter Carey, since he seldom smoked, and\\r\\nno pipe was found in his cabin. You remember that I asked whether whisky\\r\\nand brandy were in the cabin. You said they were. How many landsmen are\\r\\nthere who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits? Yes,\\r\\nI was certain it was a seaman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you find him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear sir, the problem had become a very simple one. If it were\\r\\na seaman, it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the SEA\\r\\nUNICORN. So far as I could learn he had sailed in no other ship. I\\r\\nspent three days in wiring to Dundee, and at the end of that time I had\\r\\nascertained the names of the crew of the SEA UNICORN in 1883. When I\\r\\nfound Patrick Cairns among the harpooners, my research was nearing its\\r\\nend. I argued that the man was probably in London, and that he would\\r\\ndesire to leave the country for a time. I therefore spent some days in\\r\\nthe East End, devised an Arctic expedition, put forth tempting terms for\\r\\nharpooners who would serve under Captain Basil--and behold the result!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” cried Hopkins. “Wonderful!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must obtain the release of young Neligan as soon as possible,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “I confess that I think you owe him some apology. The tin box\\r\\nmust be returned to him, but, of course, the securities which Peter\\r\\nCarey has sold are lost forever. There’s the cab, Hopkins, and you can\\r\\nremove your man. If you want me for the trial, my address and that of\\r\\nWatson will be somewhere in Norway--I’ll send particulars later.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF CHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is years since the incidents of which I speak took place, and yet it\\r\\nis with diffidence that I allude to them. For a long time, even with the\\r\\nutmost discretion and reticence, it would have been impossible to make\\r\\nthe facts public, but now the principal person concerned is beyond the\\r\\nreach of human law, and with due suppression the story may be told\\r\\nin such fashion as to injure no one. It records an absolutely unique\\r\\nexperience in the career both of Mr. Sherlock Holmes and of myself. The\\r\\nreader will excuse me if I conceal the date or any other fact by which\\r\\nhe might trace the actual occurrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been out for one of our evening rambles, Holmes and I, and had\\r\\nreturned about six o’clock on a cold, frosty winter’s evening. As Holmes\\r\\nturned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table. He glanced\\r\\nat it, and then, with an ejaculation of disgust, threw it on the floor.\\r\\nI picked it up and read:\\r\\n\\r\\nCHARLES AUGUSTUS MILVERTON, Appledore Towers, Hampstead. Agent.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is he?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The worst man in London,” Holmes answered, as he sat down and stretched\\r\\nhis legs before the fire. “Is anything on the back of the card?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned it over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Will call at 6:30--C.A.M.,” I read.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! He’s about due. Do you feel a creeping, shrinking sensation,\\r\\nWatson, when you stand before the serpents in the Zoo, and see the\\r\\nslithery, gliding, venomous creatures, with their deadly eyes and\\r\\nwicked, flattened faces? Well, that’s how Milverton impresses me. I’ve\\r\\nhad to do with fifty murderers in my career, but the worst of them never\\r\\ngave me the repulsion which I have for this fellow. And yet I can’t get\\r\\nout of doing business with him--indeed, he is here at my invitation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But who is he?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you, Watson. He is the king of all the blackmailers. Heaven\\r\\nhelp the man, and still more the woman, whose secret and reputation come\\r\\ninto the power of Milverton! With a smiling face and a heart of marble,\\r\\nhe will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry. The fellow is\\r\\na genius in his way, and would have made his mark in some more savoury\\r\\ntrade. His method is as follows: He allows it to be known that he is\\r\\nprepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of\\r\\nwealth and position. He receives these wares not only from treacherous\\r\\nvalets or maids, but frequently from genteel ruffians, who have gained\\r\\nthe confidence and affection of trusting women. He deals with no niggard\\r\\nhand. I happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman\\r\\nfor a note two lines in length, and that the ruin of a noble family was\\r\\nthe result. Everything which is in the market goes to Milverton, and\\r\\nthere are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name. No\\r\\none knows where his grip may fall, for he is far too rich and far too\\r\\ncunning to work from hand to mouth. He will hold a card back for years\\r\\nin order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning.\\r\\nI have said that he is the worst man in London, and I would ask you how\\r\\ncould one compare the ruffian, who in hot blood bludgeons his mate,\\r\\nwith this man, who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and\\r\\nwrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money-bags?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But surely,” said I, “the fellow must be within the grasp of the law?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Technically, no doubt, but practically not. What would it profit a\\r\\nwoman, for example, to get him a few months’ imprisonment if her own\\r\\nruin must immediately follow? His victims dare not hit back. If ever he\\r\\nblackmailed an innocent person, then indeed we should have him, but he\\r\\nis as cunning as the Evil One. No, no, we must find other ways to fight\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why is he here?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands.\\r\\nIt is the Lady Eva Blackwell, the most beautiful debutante of last\\r\\nseason. She is to be married in a fortnight to the Earl of Dovercourt.\\r\\nThis fiend has several imprudent letters--imprudent, Watson, nothing\\r\\nworse--which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country.\\r\\nThey would suffice to break off the match. Milverton will send the\\r\\nletters to the Earl unless a large sum of money is paid him. I have been\\r\\ncommissioned to meet him, and--to make the best terms I can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below.\\r\\nLooking down I saw a stately carriage and pair, the brilliant lamps\\r\\ngleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts. A footman\\r\\nopened the door, and a small, stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat\\r\\ndescended. A minute later he was in the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharles Augustus Milverton was a man of fifty, with a large,\\r\\nintellectual head, a round, plump, hairless face, a perpetual frozen\\r\\nsmile, and two keen gray eyes, which gleamed brightly from behind broad,\\r\\ngold-rimmed glasses. There was something of Mr. Pickwick’s benevolence\\r\\nin his appearance, marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and\\r\\nby the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes. His voice\\r\\nwas as smooth and suave as his countenance, as he advanced with a plump\\r\\nlittle hand extended, murmuring his regret for having missed us at his\\r\\nfirst visit. Holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him\\r\\nwith a face of granite. Milverton’s smile broadened, he shrugged his\\r\\nshoulders removed his overcoat, folded it with great deliberation over\\r\\nthe back of a chair, and then took a seat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman?” said he, with a wave in my direction. “Is it discreet?\\r\\nIs it right?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, Mr. Holmes. It is only in your client’s interests that I\\r\\nprotested. The matter is so very delicate----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Watson has already heard of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we can proceed to business. You say that you are acting for Lady\\r\\nEva. Has she empowered you to accept my terms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are your terms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven thousand pounds.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the alternative?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear sir, it is painful for me to discuss it, but if the money is\\r\\nnot paid on the 14th, there certainly will be no marriage on the 18th.”\\r\\n His insufferable smile was more complacent than ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes thought for a little.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You appear to me,” he said, at last, “to be taking matters too much for\\r\\ngranted. I am, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters.\\r\\nMy client will certainly do what I may advise. I shall counsel her to\\r\\ntell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMilverton chuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You evidently do not know the Earl,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the baffled look upon Holmes’s face, I could see clearly that he\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What harm is there in the letters?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are sprightly--very sprightly,” Milverton answered. “The lady\\r\\nwas a charming correspondent. But I can assure you that the Earl of\\r\\nDovercourt would fail to appreciate them. However, since you think\\r\\notherwise, we will let it rest at that. It is purely a matter of\\r\\nbusiness. If you think that it is in the best interests of your client\\r\\nthat these letters should be placed in the hands of the Earl, then you\\r\\nwould indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them.”\\r\\n He rose and seized his astrakhan coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was gray with anger and mortification.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait a little,” he said. “You go too fast. We should certainly make\\r\\nevery effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMilverton relapsed into his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was sure that you would see it in that light,” he purred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the same time,” Holmes continued, “Lady Eva is not a wealthy\\r\\nwoman. I assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her\\r\\nresources, and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power. I beg,\\r\\ntherefore, that you will moderate your demands, and that you will return\\r\\nthe letters at the price I indicate, which is, I assure you, the highest\\r\\nthat you can get.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMilverton’s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am aware that what you say is true about the lady’s resources,”\\r\\n said he. “At the same time you must admit that the occasion of a lady’s\\r\\nmarriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to\\r\\nmake some little effort upon her behalf. They may hesitate as to an\\r\\nacceptable wedding present. Let me assure them that this little bundle\\r\\nof letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter-dishes\\r\\nin London.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is impossible,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, dear me, how unfortunate!” cried Milverton, taking out a bulky\\r\\npocketbook. “I cannot help thinking that ladies are ill-advised in\\r\\nnot making an effort. Look at this!” He held up a little note with a\\r\\ncoat-of-arms upon the envelope. “That belongs to--well, perhaps it is\\r\\nhardly fair to tell the name until to-morrow morning. But at that time\\r\\nit will be in the hands of the lady’s husband. And all because she will\\r\\nnot find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds\\r\\ninto paste. It IS such a pity! Now, you remember the sudden end of the\\r\\nengagement between the Honourable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking? Only\\r\\ntwo days before the wedding, there was a paragraph in the MORNING POST\\r\\nto say that it was all off. And why? It is almost incredible, but\\r\\nthe absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole\\r\\nquestion. Is it not pitiful? And here I find you, a man of sense,\\r\\nboggling about terms, when your client’s future and honour are at stake.\\r\\nYou surprise me, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What I say is true,” Holmes answered. “The money cannot be found.\\r\\nSurely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer\\r\\nthan to ruin this woman’s career, which can profit you in no way?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me\\r\\nindirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases\\r\\nmaturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe\\r\\nexample of the Lady Eva, I should find all of them much more open to\\r\\nreason. You see my point?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get behind him, Watson! Don’t let him out! Now, sir, let us see the\\r\\ncontents of that notebook.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood\\r\\nwith his back against the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,” he said, turning the front of his coat and\\r\\nexhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside\\r\\npocket. “I have been expecting you to do something original. This has\\r\\nbeen done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you\\r\\nthat I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my\\r\\nweapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition\\r\\nthat I would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken.\\r\\nI would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two\\r\\nlittle interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.”\\r\\n He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and\\r\\nturned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head, and\\r\\nI laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle, Milverton\\r\\nwas out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the\\r\\ncarriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser\\r\\npockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing\\r\\nembers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture\\r\\nof a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed\\r\\ninto his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman, with a goatee\\r\\nbeard and a swagger, lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending\\r\\ninto the street. “I’ll be back some time, Watson,” said he, and vanished\\r\\ninto the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against\\r\\nCharles Augustus Milverton, but I little dreamed the strange shape which\\r\\nthat campaign was destined to take.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but\\r\\nbeyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was\\r\\nnot wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on\\r\\na wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against\\r\\nthe windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed\\r\\nhis disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent\\r\\ninward fashion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll be interested to hear that I’m engaged.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow! I congrat----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To Milverton’s housemaid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens, Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wanted information, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely you have gone too far?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a most necessary step. I am a plumber with a rising business,\\r\\nEscott, by name. I have walked out with her each evening, and I have\\r\\ntalked with her. Good heavens, those talks! However, I have got all I\\r\\nwanted. I know Milverton’s house as I know the palm of my hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the girl, Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t help it, my dear Watson. You must play your cards as best you\\r\\ncan when such a stake is on the table. However, I rejoice to say that\\r\\nI have a hated rival, who will certainly cut me out the instant that my\\r\\nback is turned. What a splendid night it is!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You like this weather?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It suits my purpose. Watson, I mean to burgle Milverton’s house\\r\\nto-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a catching of the breath, and my skin went cold at the words,\\r\\nwhich were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution. As a\\r\\nflash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of\\r\\na wild landscape, so at one glance I seemed to see every possible result\\r\\nof such an action--the detection, the capture, the honoured career\\r\\nending in irreparable failure and disgrace, my friend himself lying at\\r\\nthe mercy of the odious Milverton.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For heaven’s sake, Holmes, think what you are doing,” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, I have given it every consideration. I am never\\r\\nprecipitate in my actions, nor would I adopt so energetic and, indeed,\\r\\nso dangerous a course, if any other were possible. Let us look at the\\r\\nmatter clearly and fairly. I suppose that you will admit that the action\\r\\nis morally justifiable, though technically criminal. To burgle his house\\r\\nis no more than to forcibly take his pocketbook--an action in which you\\r\\nwere prepared to aid me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned it over in my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I said, “it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to\\r\\ntake no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. Since it is morally justifiable, I have only to consider the\\r\\nquestion of personal risk. Surely a gentleman should not lay much stress\\r\\nupon this, when a lady is in most desperate need of his help?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will be in such a false position.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that is part of the risk. There is no other possible way of\\r\\nregaining these letters. The unfortunate lady has not the money, and\\r\\nthere are none of her people in whom she could confide. To-morrow is\\r\\nthe last day of grace, and unless we can get the letters to-night, this\\r\\nvillain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin. I\\r\\nmust, therefore, abandon my client to her fate or I must play this\\r\\nlast card. Between ourselves, Watson, it’s a sporting duel between\\r\\nthis fellow Milverton and me. He had, as you saw, the best of the first\\r\\nexchanges, but my self-respect and my reputation are concerned to fight\\r\\nit to a finish.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t like it, but I suppose it must be,” said I. “When do we\\r\\nstart?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are not coming.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you are not going,” said I. “I give you my word of honour--and\\r\\nI never broke it in my life--that I will take a cab straight to the\\r\\npolice-station and give you away, unless you let me share this adventure\\r\\nwith you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can’t help me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How do you know that? You can’t tell what may happen. Anyway, my\\r\\nresolution is taken. Other people besides you have self-respect, and\\r\\neven reputations.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had looked annoyed, but his brow cleared, and he clapped me on\\r\\nthe shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, my dear fellow, be it so. We have shared this same room\\r\\nfor some years, and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the\\r\\nsame cell. You know, Watson, I don’t mind confessing to you that I have\\r\\nalways had an idea that I would have made a highly efficient criminal.\\r\\nThis is the chance of my lifetime in that direction. See here!” He took\\r\\na neat little leather case out of a drawer, and opening it he exhibited\\r\\na number of shining instruments. “This is a first-class, up-to-date\\r\\nburgling kit, with nickel-plated jemmy, diamond-tipped glass-cutter,\\r\\nadaptable keys, and every modern improvement which the march of\\r\\ncivilization demands. Here, too, is my dark lantern. Everything is in\\r\\norder. Have you a pair of silent shoes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have rubber-soled tennis shoes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent! And a mask?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can make a couple out of black silk.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can see that you have a strong, natural turn for this sort of thing.\\r\\nVery good, do you make the masks. We shall have some cold supper before\\r\\nwe start. It is now nine-thirty. At eleven we shall drive as far as\\r\\nChurch Row. It is a quarter of an hour’s walk from there to Appledore\\r\\nTowers. We shall be at work before midnight. Milverton is a heavy\\r\\nsleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty. With any luck we should\\r\\nbe back here by two, with the Lady Eva’s letters in my pocket.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes and I put on our dress-clothes, so that we might appear to be two\\r\\ntheatre-goers homeward bound. In Oxford Street we picked up a hansom and\\r\\ndrove to an address in Hampstead. Here we paid off our cab, and with our\\r\\ngreat coats buttoned up, for it was bitterly cold, and the wind seemed\\r\\nto blow through us, we walked along the edge of the heath.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a business that needs delicate treatment,” said Holmes. “These\\r\\ndocuments are contained in a safe in the fellow’s study, and the study\\r\\nis the ante-room of his bed-chamber. On the other hand, like all these\\r\\nstout, little men who do themselves well, he is a plethoric sleeper.\\r\\nAgatha--that’s my fiancee--says it is a joke in the servants’ hall that\\r\\nit’s impossible to wake the master. He has a secretary who is devoted\\r\\nto his interests, and never budges from the study all day. That’s why we\\r\\nare going at night. Then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden.\\r\\nI met Agatha late the last two evenings, and she locks the brute up so\\r\\nas to give me a clear run. This is the house, this big one in its own\\r\\ngrounds. Through the gate--now to the right among the laurels. We might\\r\\nput on our masks here, I think. You see, there is not a glimmer of light\\r\\nin any of the windows, and everything is working splendidly.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith our black silk face-coverings, which turned us into two of the most\\r\\ntruculent figures in London, we stole up to the silent, gloomy house.\\r\\nA sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it, lined by several\\r\\nwindows and two doors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s his bedroom,” Holmes whispered. “This door opens straight into\\r\\nthe study. It would suit us best, but it is bolted as well as locked,\\r\\nand we should make too much noise getting in. Come round here. There’s a\\r\\ngreenhouse which opens into the drawing-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe place was locked, but Holmes removed a circle of glass and turned\\r\\nthe key from the inside. An instant afterwards he had closed the door\\r\\nbehind us, and we had become felons in the eyes of the law. The thick,\\r\\nwarm air of the conservatory and the rich, choking fragrance of exotic\\r\\nplants took us by the throat. He seized my hand in the darkness and led\\r\\nme swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces. Holmes\\r\\nhad remarkable powers, carefully cultivated, of seeing in the dark.\\r\\nStill holding my hand in one of his, he opened a door, and I was vaguely\\r\\nconscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been\\r\\nsmoked not long before. He felt his way among the furniture, opened\\r\\nanother door, and closed it behind us. Putting out my hand I felt\\r\\nseveral coats hanging from the wall, and I understood that I was in a\\r\\npassage. We passed along it and Holmes very gently opened a door upon\\r\\nthe right-hand side. Something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into\\r\\nmy mouth, but I could have laughed when I realized that it was the cat.\\r\\nA fire was burning in this new room, and again the air was heavy with\\r\\ntobacco smoke. Holmes entered on tiptoe, waited for me to follow, and\\r\\nthen very gently closed the door. We were in Milverton’s study, and a\\r\\nportiere at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a good fire, and the room was illuminated by it. Near the door I\\r\\nsaw the gleam of an electric switch, but it was unnecessary, even if it\\r\\nhad been safe, to turn it on. At one side of the fireplace was a heavy\\r\\ncurtain which covered the bay window we had seen from outside. On the\\r\\nother side was the door which communicated with the veranda. A desk\\r\\nstood in the centre, with a turning-chair of shining red leather.\\r\\nOpposite was a large bookcase, with a marble bust of Athene on the top.\\r\\nIn the corner, between the bookcase and the wall, there stood a tall,\\r\\ngreen safe, the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs\\r\\nupon its face. Holmes stole across and looked at it. Then he crept\\r\\nto the door of the bedroom, and stood with slanting head listening\\r\\nintently. No sound came from within. Meanwhile it had struck me that\\r\\nit would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door, so\\r\\nI examined it. To my amazement, it was neither locked nor bolted.\\r\\nI touched Holmes on the arm, and he turned his masked face in that\\r\\ndirection. I saw him start, and he was evidently as surprised as I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like it,” he whispered, putting his lips to my very ear. “I\\r\\ncan’t quite make it out. Anyhow, we have no time to lose.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can I do anything?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, stand by the door. If you hear anyone come, bolt it on the inside,\\r\\nand we can get away as we came. If they come the other way, we can\\r\\nget through the door if our job is done, or hide behind these window\\r\\ncurtains if it is not. Do you understand?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI nodded, and stood by the door. My first feeling of fear had passed\\r\\naway, and I thrilled now with a keener zest than I had ever enjoyed when\\r\\nwe were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers. The high object\\r\\nof our mission, the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous,\\r\\nthe villainous character of our opponent, all added to the sporting\\r\\ninterest of the adventure. Far from feeling guilty, I rejoiced and\\r\\nexulted in our dangers. With a glow of admiration I watched Holmes\\r\\nunrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm,\\r\\nscientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation. I\\r\\nknew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him, and I\\r\\nunderstood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green\\r\\nand gold monster, the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of\\r\\nmany fair ladies. Turning up the cuffs of his dress-coat--he had placed\\r\\nhis overcoat on a chair--Holmes laid out two drills, a jemmy, and\\r\\nseveral skeleton keys. I stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing\\r\\nat each of the others, ready for any emergency, though, indeed, my plans\\r\\nwere somewhat vague as to what I should do if we were interrupted. For\\r\\nhalf an hour, Holmes worked with concentrated energy, laying down one\\r\\ntool, picking up another, handling each with the strength and delicacy\\r\\nof the trained mechanic. Finally I heard a click, the broad green door\\r\\nswung open, and inside I had a glimpse of a number of paper packets,\\r\\neach tied, sealed, and inscribed. Holmes picked one out, but it was as\\r\\nhard to read by the flickering fire, and he drew out his little dark\\r\\nlantern, for it was too dangerous, with Milverton in the next room, to\\r\\nswitch on the electric light. Suddenly I saw him halt, listen intently,\\r\\nand then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to, picked\\r\\nup his coat, stuffed his tools into the pockets, and darted behind the\\r\\nwindow curtain, motioning me to do the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was only when I had joined him there that I heard what had alarmed\\r\\nhis quicker senses. There was a noise somewhere within the house. A door\\r\\nslammed in the distance. Then a confused, dull murmur broke itself into\\r\\nthe measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching. They were in\\r\\nthe passage outside the room. They paused at the door. The door opened.\\r\\nThere was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on. The door\\r\\nclosed once more, and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne\\r\\nto our nostrils. Then the footsteps continued backward and forward,\\r\\nbackward and forward, within a few yards of us. Finally there was a\\r\\ncreak from a chair, and the footsteps ceased. Then a key clicked in a\\r\\nlock, and I heard the rustle of papers.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far I had not dared to look out, but now I gently parted the division\\r\\nof the curtains in front of me and peeped through. From the pressure\\r\\nof Holmes’s shoulder against mine, I knew that he was sharing my\\r\\nobservations. Right in front of us, and almost within our reach, was the\\r\\nbroad, rounded back of Milverton. It was evident that we had entirely\\r\\nmiscalculated his movements, that he had never been to his bedroom,\\r\\nbut that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the\\r\\nfarther wing of the house, the windows of which we had not seen. His\\r\\nbroad, grizzled head, with its shining patch of baldness, was in the\\r\\nimmediate foreground of our vision. He was leaning far back in the red\\r\\nleather chair, his legs outstretched, a long, black cigar projecting\\r\\nat an angle from his mouth. He wore a semi-military smoking jacket,\\r\\nclaret-coloured, with a black velvet collar. In his hand he held a long,\\r\\nlegal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion, blowing\\r\\nrings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so. There was no promise\\r\\nof a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable\\r\\nattitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt Holmes’s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake, as\\r\\nif to say that the situation was within his powers, and that he was\\r\\neasy in his mind. I was not sure whether he had seen what was only too\\r\\nobvious from my position, that the door of the safe was imperfectly\\r\\nclosed, and that Milverton might at any moment observe it. In my own\\r\\nmind I had determined that if I were sure, from the rigidity of his\\r\\ngaze, that it had caught his eye, I would at once spring out, throw my\\r\\ngreat coat over his head, pinion him, and leave the rest to Holmes. But\\r\\nMilverton never looked up. He was languidly interested by the papers in\\r\\nhis hand, and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of\\r\\nthe lawyer. At least, I thought, when he has finished the document and\\r\\nthe cigar he will go to his room, but before he had reached the end of\\r\\neither, there came a remarkable development, which turned our thoughts\\r\\ninto quite another channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral times I had observed that Milverton looked at his watch, and\\r\\nonce he had risen and sat down again, with a gesture of impatience. The\\r\\nidea, however, that he might have an appointment at so strange an\\r\\nhour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from\\r\\nthe veranda outside. Milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his\\r\\nchair. The sound was repeated, and then there came a gentle tap at the\\r\\ndoor. Milverton rose and opened it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said he, curtly, “you are nearly half an hour late.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal\\r\\nvigil of Milverton. There was the gentle rustle of a woman’s dress. I\\r\\nhad closed the slit between the curtains as Milverton’s face had turned\\r\\nin our direction, but now I ventured very carefully to open it once\\r\\nmore. He had resumed his seat, the cigar still projecting at an insolent\\r\\nangle from the corner of his mouth. In front of him, in the full glare\\r\\nof the electric light, there stood a tall, slim, dark woman, a veil over\\r\\nher face, a mantle drawn round her chin. Her breath came quick and fast,\\r\\nand every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said Milverton, “you made me lose a good night’s rest, my dear.\\r\\nI hope you’ll prove worth it. You couldn’t come any other time--eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman shook her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if you couldn’t you couldn’t. If the Countess is a hard mistress,\\r\\nyou have your chance to get level with her now. Bless the girl, what are\\r\\nyou shivering about? That’s right. Pull yourself together. Now, let us\\r\\nget down to business.” He took a notebook from the drawer of his desk.\\r\\n“You say that you have five letters which compromise the Countess\\r\\nd’Albert. You want to sell them. I want to buy them. So far so good. It\\r\\nonly remains to fix a price. I should want to inspect the letters, of\\r\\ncourse. If they are really good specimens--Great heavens, is it you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman, without a word, had raised her veil and dropped the mantle\\r\\nfrom her chin. It was a dark, handsome, clear-cut face which confronted\\r\\nMilverton--a face with a curved nose, strong, dark eyebrows shading\\r\\nhard, glittering eyes, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth set in a\\r\\ndangerous smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is I,” she said, “the woman whose life you have ruined.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMilverton laughed, but fear vibrated in his voice. “You were so very\\r\\nobstinate,” said he. “Why did you drive me to such extremities? I\\r\\nassure you I wouldn’t hurt a fly of my own accord, but every man has his\\r\\nbusiness, and what was I to do? I put the price well within your means.\\r\\nYou would not pay.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So you sent the letters to my husband, and he--the noblest gentleman\\r\\nthat ever lived, a man whose boots I was never worthy to lace--he broke\\r\\nhis gallant heart and died. You remember that last night, when I came\\r\\nthrough that door, I begged and prayed you for mercy, and you laughed\\r\\nin my face as you are trying to laugh now, only your coward heart cannot\\r\\nkeep your lips from twitching. Yes, you never thought to see me here\\r\\nagain, but it was that night which taught me how I could meet you face\\r\\nto face, and alone. Well, Charles Milverton, what have you to say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t imagine that you can bully me,” said he, rising to his feet. “I\\r\\nhave only to raise my voice and I could call my servants and have you\\r\\narrested. But I will make allowance for your natural anger. Leave the\\r\\nroom at once as you came, and I will say no more.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom, and the same deadly\\r\\nsmile on her thin lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will ruin no more lives as you have ruined mine. You will wring\\r\\nno more hearts as you wrung mine. I will free the world of a poisonous\\r\\nthing. Take that, you hound--and that!--and that!--and that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had drawn a little gleaming revolver, and emptied barrel after\\r\\nbarrel into Milverton’s body, the muzzle within two feet of his shirt\\r\\nfront. He shrank away and then fell forward upon the table, coughing\\r\\nfuriously and clawing among the papers. Then he staggered to his feet,\\r\\nreceived another shot, and rolled upon the floor. “You’ve done me,” he\\r\\ncried, and lay still. The woman looked at him intently, and ground her\\r\\nheel into his upturned face. She looked again, but there was no sound\\r\\nor movement. I heard a sharp rustle, the night air blew into the heated\\r\\nroom, and the avenger was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate,\\r\\nbut, as the woman poured bullet after bullet into Milverton’s shrinking\\r\\nbody I was about to spring out, when I felt Holmes’s cold, strong grasp\\r\\nupon my wrist. I understood the whole argument of that firm, restraining\\r\\ngrip--that it was no affair of ours, that justice had overtaken a\\r\\nvillain, that we had our own duties and our own objects, which were not\\r\\nto be lost sight of. But hardly had the woman rushed from the room when\\r\\nHolmes, with swift, silent steps, was over at the other door. He turned\\r\\nthe key in the lock. At the same instant we heard voices in the house\\r\\nand the sound of hurrying feet. The revolver shots had roused the\\r\\nhousehold. With perfect coolness Holmes slipped across to the safe,\\r\\nfilled his two arms with bundles of letters, and poured them all into\\r\\nthe fire. Again and again he did it, until the safe was empty. Someone\\r\\nturned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door. Holmes looked\\r\\nswiftly round. The letter which had been the messenger of death for\\r\\nMilverton lay, all mottled with his blood, upon the table. Holmes tossed\\r\\nit in among the blazing papers. Then he drew the key from the outer\\r\\ndoor, passed through after me, and locked it on the outside. “This way,\\r\\nWatson,” said he, “we can scale the garden wall in this direction.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly.\\r\\nLooking back, the huge house was one blaze of light. The front door\\r\\nwas open, and figures were rushing down the drive. The whole garden was\\r\\nalive with people, and one fellow raised a view-halloa as we emerged\\r\\nfrom the veranda and followed hard at our heels. Holmes seemed to\\r\\nknow the grounds perfectly, and he threaded his way swiftly among\\r\\na plantation of small trees, I close at his heels, and our foremost\\r\\npursuer panting behind us. It was a six-foot wall which barred our path,\\r\\nbut he sprang to the top and over. As I did the same I felt the hand\\r\\nof the man behind me grab at my ankle, but I kicked myself free and\\r\\nscrambled over a grass-strewn coping. I fell upon my face among some\\r\\nbushes, but Holmes had me on my feet in an instant, and together we\\r\\ndashed away across the huge expanse of Hampstead Heath. We had run two\\r\\nmiles, I suppose, before Holmes at last halted and listened intently.\\r\\nAll was absolute silence behind us. We had shaken off our pursuers and\\r\\nwere safe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after\\r\\nthe remarkable experience which I have recorded, when Mr. Lestrade, of\\r\\nScotland Yard, very solemn and impressive, was ushered into our modest\\r\\nsitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-morning, Mr. Holmes,” said he; “good-morning. May I ask if you are\\r\\nvery busy just now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not too busy to listen to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought that, perhaps, if you had nothing particular on hand, you\\r\\nmight care to assist us in a most remarkable case, which occurred only\\r\\nlast night at Hampstead.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” said Holmes. “What was that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A murder--a most dramatic and remarkable murder. I know how keen you\\r\\nare upon these things, and I would take it as a great favour if you\\r\\nwould step down to Appledore Towers, and give us the benefit of your\\r\\nadvice. It is no ordinary crime. We have had our eyes upon this Mr.\\r\\nMilverton for some time, and, between ourselves, he was a bit of a\\r\\nvillain. He is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing\\r\\npurposes. These papers have all been burned by the murderers. No article\\r\\nof value was taken, as it is probable that the criminals were men of\\r\\ngood position, whose sole object was to prevent social exposure.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Criminals?” said Holmes. “Plural?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there were two of them. They were as nearly as possible captured\\r\\nred-handed. We have their footmarks, we have their description, it’s ten\\r\\nto one that we trace them. The first fellow was a bit too active, but\\r\\nthe second was caught by the under-gardener, and only got away after a\\r\\nstruggle. He was a middle-sized, strongly built man--square jaw, thick\\r\\nneck, moustache, a mask over his eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s rather vague,” said Sherlock Holmes. “My, it might be a\\r\\ndescription of Watson!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s true,” said the inspector, with amusement. “It might be a\\r\\ndescription of Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’m afraid I can’t help you, Lestrade,” said Holmes. “The fact is\\r\\nthat I knew this fellow Milverton, that I considered him one of the most\\r\\ndangerous men in London, and that I think there are certain crimes\\r\\nwhich the law cannot touch, and which therefore, to some extent, justify\\r\\nprivate revenge. No, it’s no use arguing. I have made up my mind. My\\r\\nsympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim, and I\\r\\nwill not handle this case.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had\\r\\nwitnessed, but I observed all the morning that he was in his most\\r\\nthoughtful mood, and he gave me the impression, from his vacant eyes and\\r\\nhis abstracted manner, of a man who is striving to recall something to\\r\\nhis memory. We were in the middle of our lunch, when he suddenly sprang\\r\\nto his feet. “By Jove, Watson, I’ve got it!” he cried. “Take your hat!\\r\\nCome with me!” He hurried at his top speed down Baker Street and along\\r\\nOxford Street, until we had almost reached Regent Circus. Here, on the\\r\\nleft hand, there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the\\r\\ncelebrities and beauties of the day. Holmes’s eyes fixed themselves upon\\r\\none of them, and following his gaze I saw the picture of a regal and\\r\\nstately lady in Court dress, with a high diamond tiara upon her noble\\r\\nhead. I looked at that delicately curved nose, at the marked eyebrows,\\r\\nat the straight mouth, and the strong little chin beneath it. Then I\\r\\ncaught my breath as I read the time-honoured title of the great nobleman\\r\\nand statesman whose wife she had been. My eyes met those of Holmes, and\\r\\nhe put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SIX NAPOLEONS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was no very unusual thing for Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, to\\r\\nlook in upon us of an evening, and his visits were welcome to Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on\\r\\nat the police headquarters. In return for the news which Lestrade would\\r\\nbring, Holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the\\r\\ndetails of any case upon which the detective was engaged, and was able\\r\\noccasionally, without any active interference, to give some hint or\\r\\nsuggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn this particular evening, Lestrade had spoken of the weather and\\r\\nthe newspapers. Then he had fallen silent, puffing thoughtfully at his\\r\\ncigar. Holmes looked keenly at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anything remarkable on hand?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, Mr. Holmes--nothing very particular.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then tell me about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade laughed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, there is no use denying that there IS something on my\\r\\nmind. And yet it is such an absurd business, that I hesitated to\\r\\nbother you about it. On the other hand, although it is trivial, it is\\r\\nundoubtedly queer, and I know that you have a taste for all that is out\\r\\nof the common. But, in my opinion, it comes more in Dr. Watson’s line\\r\\nthan ours.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Disease?” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Madness, anyhow. And a queer madness, too. You wouldn’t think there was\\r\\nanyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of Napoleon the\\r\\nFirst that he would break any image of him that he could see.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sank back in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s no business of mine,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. That’s what I said. But then, when the man commits burglary\\r\\nin order to break images which are not his own, that brings it away from\\r\\nthe doctor and on to the policeman.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat up again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Burglary! This is more interesting. Let me hear the details.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory from\\r\\nits pages.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first case reported was four days ago,” said he. “It was at the\\r\\nshop of Morse Hudson, who has a place for the sale of pictures and\\r\\nstatues in the Kennington Road. The assistant had left the front shop\\r\\nfor an instant, when he heard a crash, and hurrying in he found a\\r\\nplaster bust of Napoleon, which stood with several other works of art\\r\\nupon the counter, lying shivered into fragments. He rushed out into the\\r\\nroad, but, although several passers-by declared that they had noticed a\\r\\nman run out of the shop, he could neither see anyone nor could he\\r\\nfind any means of identifying the rascal. It seemed to be one of those\\r\\nsenseless acts of Hooliganism which occur from time to time, and it was\\r\\nreported to the constable on the beat as such. The plaster cast was not\\r\\nworth more than a few shillings, and the whole affair appeared to be too\\r\\nchildish for any particular investigation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The second case, however, was more serious, and also more singular. It\\r\\noccurred only last night.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In Kennington Road, and within a few hundred yards of Morse Hudson’s\\r\\nshop, there lives a well-known medical practitioner, named Dr. Barnicot,\\r\\nwho has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the Thames.\\r\\nHis residence and principal consulting-room is at Kennington Road, but\\r\\nhe has a branch surgery and dispensary at Lower Brixton Road, two miles\\r\\naway. This Dr. Barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of Napoleon, and his\\r\\nhouse is full of books, pictures, and relics of the French Emperor. Some\\r\\nlittle time ago he purchased from Morse Hudson two duplicate plaster\\r\\ncasts of the famous head of Napoleon by the French sculptor, Devine. One\\r\\nof these he placed in his hall in the house at Kennington Road, and the\\r\\nother on the mantelpiece of the surgery at Lower Brixton. Well, when Dr.\\r\\nBarnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house\\r\\nhad been burgled during the night, but that nothing had been taken save\\r\\nthe plaster head from the hall. It had been carried out and had been\\r\\ndashed savagely against the garden wall, under which its splintered\\r\\nfragments were discovered.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rubbed his hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is certainly very novel,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought it would please you. But I have not got to the end yet. Dr.\\r\\nBarnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o’clock, and you can imagine\\r\\nhis amazement when, on arriving there, he found that the window had been\\r\\nopened in the night and that the broken pieces of his second bust were\\r\\nstrewn all over the room. It had been smashed to atoms where it stood.\\r\\nIn neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to\\r\\nthe criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief. Now, Mr. Holmes, you\\r\\nhave got the facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are singular, not to say grotesque,” said Holmes. “May I ask\\r\\nwhether the two busts smashed in Dr. Barnicot’s rooms were the exact\\r\\nduplicates of the one which was destroyed in Morse Hudson’s shop?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were taken from the same mould.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them\\r\\nis influenced by any general hatred of Napoleon. Considering how many\\r\\nhundreds of statues of the great Emperor must exist in London, it is\\r\\ntoo much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast\\r\\nshould chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I thought as you do,” said Lestrade. “On the other hand, this\\r\\nMorse Hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of London, and these\\r\\nthree were the only ones which had been in his shop for years. So,\\r\\nalthough, as you say, there are many hundreds of statues in London, it\\r\\nis very probable that these three were the only ones in that district.\\r\\nTherefore, a local fanatic would begin with them. What do you think, Dr.\\r\\nWatson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are no limits to the possibilities of monomania,” I answered.\\r\\n“There is the condition which the modern French psychologists have\\r\\ncalled the ‘IDEE FIXE,’ which may be trifling in character, and\\r\\naccompanied by complete sanity in every other way. A man who had read\\r\\ndeeply about Napoleon, or who had possibly received some hereditary\\r\\nfamily injury through the great war, might conceivably form such an IDEE\\r\\nFIXE and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That won’t do, my dear Watson,” said Holmes, shaking his head, “for no\\r\\namount of IDEE FIXE would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out\\r\\nwhere these busts were situated.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, how do YOU explain it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t attempt to do so. I would only observe that there is a certain\\r\\nmethod in the gentleman’s eccentric proceedings. For example, in Dr.\\r\\nBarnicot’s hall, where a sound might arouse the family, the bust was\\r\\ntaken outside before being broken, whereas in the surgery, where there\\r\\nwas less danger of an alarm, it was smashed where it stood. The affair\\r\\nseems absurdly trifling, and yet I dare call nothing trivial when I\\r\\nreflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising\\r\\ncommencement. You will remember, Watson, how the dreadful business of\\r\\nthe Abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which\\r\\nthe parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day. I can’t afford,\\r\\ntherefore, to smile at your three broken busts, Lestrade, and I shall\\r\\nbe very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh\\r\\ndevelopment of so singular a chain of events.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an\\r\\ninfinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined. I was still\\r\\ndressing in my bedroom next morning, when there was a tap at the door\\r\\nand Holmes entered, a telegram in his hand. He read it aloud:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come instantly, 131 Pitt Street, Kensington.\\r\\n\\r\\n“LESTRADE.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t know--may be anything. But I suspect it is the sequel of the\\r\\nstory of the statues. In that case our friend the image-breaker has\\r\\nbegun operations in another quarter of London. There’s coffee on the\\r\\ntable, Watson, and I have a cab at the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn half an hour we had reached Pitt Street, a quiet little backwater\\r\\njust beside one of the briskest currents of London life. No. 131 was one\\r\\nof a row, all flat-chested, respectable, and most unromantic dwellings.\\r\\nAs we drove up, we found the railings in front of the house lined by a\\r\\ncurious crowd. Holmes whistled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By George! It’s attempted murder at the least. Nothing less will hold\\r\\nthe London message-boy. There’s a deed of violence indicated in that\\r\\nfellow’s round shoulders and outstretched neck. What’s this, Watson? The\\r\\ntop steps swilled down and the other ones dry. Footsteps enough, anyhow!\\r\\nWell, well, there’s Lestrade at the front window, and we shall soon know\\r\\nall about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a\\r\\nsitting-room, where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly\\r\\nman, clad in a flannel dressing-gown, was pacing up and down. He was\\r\\nintroduced to us as the owner of the house--Mr. Horace Harker, of the\\r\\nCentral Press Syndicate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the Napoleon bust business again,” said Lestrade. “You seemed\\r\\ninterested last night, Mr. Holmes, so I thought perhaps you would be\\r\\nglad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver\\r\\nturn.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has it turned to, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To murder. Mr. Harker, will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has\\r\\noccurred?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man in the dressing-gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s an extraordinary thing,” said he, “that all my life I have been\\r\\ncollecting other people’s news, and now that a real piece of news has\\r\\ncome my own way I am so confused and bothered that I can’t put two\\r\\nwords together. If I had come in here as a journalist, I should have\\r\\ninterviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper. As it is,\\r\\nI am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a\\r\\nstring of different people, and I can make no use of it myself. However,\\r\\nI’ve heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and if you’ll only explain\\r\\nthis queer business, I shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the\\r\\nstory.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes sat down and listened.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It all seems to centre round that bust of Napoleon which I bought for\\r\\nthis very room about four months ago. I picked it up cheap from Harding\\r\\nBrothers, two doors from the High Street Station. A great deal of my\\r\\njournalistic work is done at night, and I often write until the early\\r\\nmorning. So it was to-day. I was sitting in my den, which is at the back\\r\\nof the top of the house, about three o’clock, when I was convinced that\\r\\nI heard some sounds downstairs. I listened, but they were not repeated,\\r\\nand I concluded that they came from outside. Then suddenly, about five\\r\\nminutes later, there came a most horrible yell--the most dreadful sound,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, that ever I heard. It will ring in my ears as long as I\\r\\nlive. I sat frozen with horror for a minute or two. Then I seized the\\r\\npoker and went downstairs. When I entered this room I found the window\\r\\nwide open, and I at once observed that the bust was gone from the\\r\\nmantelpiece. Why any burglar should take such a thing passes my\\r\\nunderstanding, for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value\\r\\nwhatever.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window\\r\\ncould reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride. This was clearly\\r\\nwhat the burglar had done, so I went round and opened the door. Stepping\\r\\nout into the dark, I nearly fell over a dead man, who was lying there. I\\r\\nran back for a light and there was the poor fellow, a great gash in his\\r\\nthroat and the whole place swimming in blood. He lay on his back, his\\r\\nknees drawn up, and his mouth horribly open. I shall see him in my\\r\\ndreams. I had just time to blow on my police-whistle, and then I must\\r\\nhave fainted, for I knew nothing more until I found the policeman\\r\\nstanding over me in the hall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, who was the murdered man?” asked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s nothing to show who he was,” said Lestrade. “You shall see the\\r\\nbody at the mortuary, but we have made nothing of it up to now. He is a\\r\\ntall man, sunburned, very powerful, not more than thirty. He is poorly\\r\\ndressed, and yet does not appear to be a labourer. A horn-handled clasp\\r\\nknife was lying in a pool of blood beside him. Whether it was the weapon\\r\\nwhich did the deed, or whether it belonged to the dead man, I do not\\r\\nknow. There was no name on his clothing, and nothing in his pockets save\\r\\nan apple, some string, a shilling map of London, and a photograph. Here\\r\\nit is.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera. It represented\\r\\nan alert, sharp-featured simian man, with thick eyebrows and a very\\r\\npeculiar projection of the lower part of the face, like the muzzle of a\\r\\nbaboon.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what became of the bust?” asked Holmes, after a careful study of\\r\\nthis picture.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We had news of it just before you came. It has been found in the front\\r\\ngarden of an empty house in Campden House Road. It was broken into\\r\\nfragments. I am going round now to see it. Will you come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. I must just take one look round.” He examined the carpet and\\r\\nthe window. “The fellow had either very long legs or was a most active\\r\\nman,” said he. “With an area beneath, it was no mean feat to reach\\r\\nthat window ledge and open that window. Getting back was comparatively\\r\\nsimple. Are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust, Mr.\\r\\nHarker?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing-table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must try and make something of it,” said he, “though I have no doubt\\r\\nthat the first editions of the evening papers are out already with\\r\\nfull details. It’s like my luck! You remember when the stand fell at\\r\\nDoncaster? Well, I was the only journalist in the stand, and my journal\\r\\nthe only one that had no account of it, for I was too shaken to write\\r\\nit. And now I’ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we left the room, we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the\\r\\nfoolscap.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a\\r\\nfew hundred yards away. For the first time our eyes rested upon this\\r\\npresentment of the great emperor, which seemed to raise such frantic\\r\\nand destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown. It lay scattered, in\\r\\nsplintered shards, upon the grass. Holmes picked up several of them and\\r\\nexamined them carefully. I was convinced, from his intent face and his\\r\\npurposeful manner, that at last he was upon a clue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” asked Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a long way to go yet,” said he. “And yet--and yet--well, we\\r\\nhave some suggestive facts to act upon. The possession of this trifling\\r\\nbust was worth more, in the eyes of this strange criminal, than a human\\r\\nlife. That is one point. Then there is the singular fact that he did not\\r\\nbreak it in the house, or immediately outside the house, if to break it\\r\\nwas his sole object.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow. He hardly knew\\r\\nwhat he was doing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s likely enough. But I wish to call your attention very\\r\\nparticularly to the position of this house, in the garden of which the\\r\\nbust was destroyed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade looked about him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was an empty house, and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in\\r\\nthe garden.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but there is another empty house farther up the street which he\\r\\nmust have passed before he came to this one. Why did he not break it\\r\\nthere, since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased\\r\\nthe risk of someone meeting him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I give it up,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He could see what he was doing here, and he could not there. That was\\r\\nhis reason.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By Jove! that’s true,” said the detective. “Now that I come to think of\\r\\nit, Dr. Barnicot’s bust was broken not far from his red lamp. Well, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, what are we to do with that fact?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To remember it--to docket it. We may come on something later which will\\r\\nbear upon it. What steps do you propose to take now, Lestrade?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The most practical way of getting at it, in my opinion, is to identify\\r\\nthe dead man. There should be no difficulty about that. When we have\\r\\nfound who he is and who his associates are, we should have a good start\\r\\nin learning what he was doing in Pitt Street last night, and who it was\\r\\nwho met him and killed him on the doorstep of Mr. Horace Harker. Don’t\\r\\nyou think so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt; and yet it is not quite the way in which I should approach\\r\\nthe case.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What would you do then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you must not let me influence you in any way. I suggest that you\\r\\ngo on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each\\r\\nwill supplement the other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you are going back to Pitt Street, you might see Mr. Horace Harker.\\r\\nTell him for me that I have quite made up my mind, and that it is\\r\\ncertain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic, with Napoleonic delusions,\\r\\nwas in his house last night. It will be useful for his article.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade stared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t seriously believe that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t I? Well, perhaps I don’t. But I am sure that it will interest Mr.\\r\\nHorace Harker and the subscribers of the Central Press Syndicate.\\r\\nNow, Watson, I think that we shall find that we have a long and rather\\r\\ncomplex day’s work before us. I should be glad, Lestrade, if you could\\r\\nmake it convenient to meet us at Baker Street at six o’clock this\\r\\nevening. Until then I should like to keep this photograph, found in the\\r\\ndead man’s pocket. It is possible that I may have to ask your company\\r\\nand assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken\\r\\nto-night, if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct. Until\\r\\nthen good-bye and good luck!”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I walked together to the High Street, where we\\r\\nstopped at the shop of Harding Brothers, whence the bust had been\\r\\npurchased. A young assistant informed us that Mr. Harding would be\\r\\nabsent until afternoon, and that he was himself a newcomer, who could\\r\\ngive us no information. Holmes’s face showed his disappointment and\\r\\nannoyance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, we can’t expect to have it all our own way, Watson,” he\\r\\nsaid, at last. “We must come back in the afternoon, if Mr. Harding\\r\\nwill not be here until then. I am, as you have no doubt surmised,\\r\\nendeavouring to trace these busts to their source, in order to find if\\r\\nthere is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable\\r\\nfate. Let us make for Mr. Morse Hudson, of the Kennington Road, and see\\r\\nif he can throw any light upon the problem.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA drive of an hour brought us to the picture-dealer’s establishment. He\\r\\nwas a small, stout man with a red face and a peppery manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. On my very counter, sir,” said he. “What we pay rates and\\r\\ntaxes for I don’t know, when any ruffian can come in and break one’s\\r\\ngoods. Yes, sir, it was I who sold Dr. Barnicot his two statues.\\r\\nDisgraceful, sir! A Nihilist plot--that’s what I make it. No one but an\\r\\nanarchist would go about breaking statues. Red republicans--that’s what\\r\\nI call ‘em. Who did I get the statues from? I don’t see what that has to\\r\\ndo with it. Well, if you really want to know, I got them from Gelder\\r\\n& Co., in Church Street, Stepney. They are a well-known house in the\\r\\ntrade, and have been this twenty years. How many had I? Three--two and\\r\\none are three--two of Dr. Barnicot’s, and one smashed in broad daylight\\r\\non my own counter. Do I know that photograph? No, I don’t. Yes, I do,\\r\\nthough. Why, it’s Beppo. He was a kind of Italian piece-work man, who\\r\\nmade himself useful in the shop. He could carve a bit, and gild and\\r\\nframe, and do odd jobs. The fellow left me last week, and I’ve heard\\r\\nnothing of him since. No, I don’t know where he came from nor where he\\r\\nwent to. I had nothing against him while he was here. He was gone two\\r\\ndays before the bust was smashed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s all we could reasonably expect from Morse Hudson,” said\\r\\nHolmes, as we emerged from the shop. “We have this Beppo as a common\\r\\nfactor, both in Kennington and in Kensington, so that is worth a\\r\\nten-mile drive. Now, Watson, let us make for Gelder & Co., of Stepney,\\r\\nthe source and origin of the busts. I shall be surprised if we don’t get\\r\\nsome help down there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable London,\\r\\nhotel London, theatrical London, literary London, commercial London,\\r\\nand, finally, maritime London, till we came to a riverside city of a\\r\\nhundred thousand souls, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with\\r\\nthe outcasts of Europe. Here, in a broad thoroughfare, once the abode\\r\\nof wealthy City merchants, we found the sculpture works for which we\\r\\nsearched. Outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry.\\r\\nInside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding.\\r\\nThe manager, a big blond German, received us civilly and gave a clear\\r\\nanswer to all Holmes’s questions. A reference to his books showed that\\r\\nhundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of Devine’s head of\\r\\nNapoleon, but that the three which had been sent to Morse Hudson a year\\r\\nor so before had been half of a batch of six, the other three being sent\\r\\nto Harding Brothers, of Kensington. There was no reason why those six\\r\\nshould be different from any of the other casts. He could suggest no\\r\\npossible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them--in fact, he\\r\\nlaughed at the idea. Their wholesale price was six shillings, but the\\r\\nretailer would get twelve or more. The cast was taken in two moulds from\\r\\neach side of the face, and then these two profiles of plaster of Paris\\r\\nwere joined together to make the complete bust. The work was usually\\r\\ndone by Italians, in the room we were in. When finished, the busts were\\r\\nput on a table in the passage to dry, and afterwards stored. That was\\r\\nall he could tell us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the\\r\\nmanager. His face flushed with anger, and his brows knotted over his\\r\\nblue Teutonic eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, the rascal!” he cried. “Yes, indeed, I know him very well. This has\\r\\nalways been a respectable establishment, and the only time that we have\\r\\never had the police in it was over this very fellow. It was more than a\\r\\nyear ago now. He knifed another Italian in the street, and then he came\\r\\nto the works with the police on his heels, and he was taken here. Beppo\\r\\nwas his name--his second name I never knew. Serve me right for engaging\\r\\na man with such a face. But he was a good workman--one of the best.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did he get?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man lived and he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is out\\r\\nnow, but he has not dared to show his nose here. We have a cousin of his\\r\\nhere, and I daresay he could tell you where he is.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no,” cried Holmes, “not a word to the cousin--not a word, I beg\\r\\nof you. The matter is very important, and the farther I go with it, the\\r\\nmore important it seems to grow. When you referred in your ledger to the\\r\\nsale of those casts I observed that the date was June 3rd of last year.\\r\\nCould you give me the date when Beppo was arrested?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could tell you roughly by the pay-list,” the manager answered. “Yes,”\\r\\n he continued, after some turning over of pages, “he was paid last on May\\r\\n20th.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Holmes. “I don’t think that I need intrude upon your\\r\\ntime and patience any more.” With a last word of caution that he should\\r\\nsay nothing as to our researches, we turned our faces westward once\\r\\nmore.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty\\r\\nluncheon at a restaurant. A news-bill at the entrance announced\\r\\n“Kensington Outrage. Murder by a Madman,” and the contents of the paper\\r\\nshowed that Mr. Horace Harker had got his account into print after\\r\\nall. Two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery\\r\\nrendering of the whole incident. Holmes propped it against the\\r\\ncruet-stand and read it while he ate. Once or twice he chuckled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is all right, Watson,” said he. “Listen to this:\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion\\r\\nupon this case, since Mr. Lestrade, one of the most experienced\\r\\nmembers of the official force, and Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the well known\\r\\nconsulting expert, have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque\\r\\nseries of incidents, which have ended in so tragic a fashion, arise from\\r\\nlunacy rather than from deliberate crime. No explanation save mental\\r\\naberration can cover the facts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Press, Watson, is a most valuable institution, if you only know how\\r\\nto use it. And now, if you have quite finished, we will hark back to\\r\\nKensington and see what the manager of Harding Brothers has to say on\\r\\nthe matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk, crisp little\\r\\nperson, very dapper and quick, with a clear head and a ready tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I have already read the account in the evening papers. Mr.\\r\\nHorace Harker is a customer of ours. We supplied him with the bust some\\r\\nmonths ago. We ordered three busts of that sort from Gelder & Co., of\\r\\nStepney. They are all sold now. To whom? Oh, I daresay by consulting our\\r\\nsales book we could very easily tell you. Yes, we have the entries here.\\r\\nOne to Mr. Harker you see, and one to Mr. Josiah Brown, of Laburnum\\r\\nLodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick, and one to Mr. Sandeford, of Lower Grove\\r\\nRoad, Reading. No, I have never seen this face which you show me in the\\r\\nphotograph. You would hardly forget it, would you, sir, for I’ve seldom\\r\\nseen an uglier. Have we any Italians on the staff? Yes, sir, we have\\r\\nseveral among our workpeople and cleaners. I daresay they might get a\\r\\npeep at that sales book if they wanted to. There is no particular reason\\r\\nfor keeping a watch upon that book. Well, well, it’s a very strange\\r\\nbusiness, and I hope that you will let me know if anything comes of your\\r\\ninquiries.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had taken several notes during Mr. Harding’s evidence, and I\\r\\ncould see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs\\r\\nwere taking. He made no remark, however, save that, unless we hurried,\\r\\nwe should be late for our appointment with Lestrade. Sure enough, when\\r\\nwe reached Baker Street the detective was already there, and we found\\r\\nhim pacing up and down in a fever of impatience. His look of importance\\r\\nshowed that his day’s work had not been in vain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” he asked. “What luck, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have had a very busy day, and not entirely a wasted one,” my friend\\r\\nexplained. “We have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale\\r\\nmanufacturers. I can trace each of the busts now from the beginning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The busts,” cried Lestrade. “Well, well, you have your own methods, Mr.\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, and it is not for me to say a word against them, but\\r\\nI think I have done a better day’s work than you. I have identified the\\r\\ndead man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t say so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And found a cause for the crime.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Splendid!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the\\r\\nItalian Quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round his\\r\\nneck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from the\\r\\nSouth. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him. His\\r\\nname is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the greatest\\r\\ncut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia, which, as you\\r\\nknow, is a secret political society, enforcing its decrees by murder.\\r\\nNow, you see how the affair begins to clear up. The other fellow is\\r\\nprobably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia. He has broken\\r\\nthe rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his track. Probably the\\r\\nphotograph we found in his pocket is the man himself, so that he may not\\r\\nknife the wrong person. He dogs the fellow, he sees him enter a house,\\r\\nhe waits outside for him, and in the scuffle he receives his own\\r\\ndeath-wound. How is that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes clapped his hands approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!” he cried. “But I didn’t quite follow\\r\\nyour explanation of the destruction of the busts.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After all,\\r\\nthat is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is the murder\\r\\nthat we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am gathering all\\r\\nthe threads into my hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the next stage?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian Quarter,\\r\\nfind the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on the charge\\r\\nof murder. Will you come with us?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can’t\\r\\nsay for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon\\r\\na factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great\\r\\nhopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will come\\r\\nwith us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the Italian Quarter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him. If\\r\\nyou will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I’ll promise to go\\r\\nto the Italian Quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be done by\\r\\nthe delay. And now I think that a few hours’ sleep would do us all good,\\r\\nfor I do not propose to leave before eleven o’clock, and it is unlikely\\r\\nthat we shall be back before morning. You’ll dine with us, Lestrade, and\\r\\nthen you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start. In\\r\\nthe meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you would ring for an express\\r\\nmessenger, for I have a letter to send and it is important that it\\r\\nshould go at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily\\r\\npapers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at last\\r\\nhe descended, it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said nothing to\\r\\neither of us as to the result of his researches. For my own part, I had\\r\\nfollowed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various\\r\\nwindings of this complex case, and, though I could not yet perceive the\\r\\ngoal which we would reach, I understood clearly that Holmes expected\\r\\nthis grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts,\\r\\none of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick. No doubt the object of our\\r\\njourney was to catch him in the very act, and I could not but admire the\\r\\ncunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening\\r\\npaper, so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his\\r\\nscheme with impunity. I was not surprised when Holmes suggested that\\r\\nI should take my revolver with me. He had himself picked up the loaded\\r\\nhunting-crop, which was his favourite weapon.\\r\\n\\r\\nA four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a spot\\r\\nat the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was directed to\\r\\nwait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed with pleasant\\r\\nhouses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light of a street\\r\\nlamp we read “Laburnum Villa” upon the gate-post of one of them. The\\r\\noccupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was dark save for a\\r\\nfanlight over the hall door, which shed a single blurred circle on to\\r\\nthe garden path. The wooden fence which separated the grounds from the\\r\\nroad threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side, and here it was\\r\\nthat we crouched.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear that you’ll have a long wait,” Holmes whispered. “We may thank\\r\\nour stars that it is not raining. I don’t think we can even venture to\\r\\nsmoke to pass the time. However, it’s a two to one chance that we get\\r\\nsomething to pay us for our trouble.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes had\\r\\nled us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion. In\\r\\nan instant, without the least sound to warn us of his coming, the garden\\r\\ngate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as swift and active as an\\r\\nape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it whisk past the light thrown\\r\\nfrom over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house.\\r\\nThere was a long pause, during which we held our breath, and then a very\\r\\ngentle creaking sound came to our ears. The window was being opened. The\\r\\nnoise ceased, and again there was a long silence. The fellow was making\\r\\nhis way into the house. We saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside\\r\\nthe room. What he sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the\\r\\nflash through another blind, and then through another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,”\\r\\n Lestrade whispered.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before we could move, the man had emerged again. As he came out into\\r\\nthe glimmering patch of light, we saw that he carried something white\\r\\nunder his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence of the\\r\\ndeserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he laid down\\r\\nhis burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap,\\r\\nfollowed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent upon what he was\\r\\ndoing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot.\\r\\nWith the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his back, and an instant later\\r\\nLestrade and I had him by either wrist, and the handcuffs had been\\r\\nfastened. As we turned him over I saw a hideous, sallow face, with\\r\\nwrithing, furious features, glaring up at us, and I knew that it was\\r\\nindeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention.\\r\\nSquatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining\\r\\nthat which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of\\r\\nNapoleon, like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been\\r\\nbroken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate shard\\r\\nto the light, but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece\\r\\nof plaster. He had just completed his examination when the hall lights\\r\\nflew up, the door opened, and the owner of the house, a jovial, rotund\\r\\nfigure in shirt and trousers, presented himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the note\\r\\nwhich you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you told\\r\\nme. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments. Well,\\r\\nI’m very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope, gentlemen,\\r\\nthat you will come in and have some refreshment.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so\\r\\nwithin a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon\\r\\nour way to London. Not a word would our captive say, but he glared at us\\r\\nfrom the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my hand seemed within\\r\\nhis reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We stayed long enough\\r\\nat the police-station to learn that a search of his clothing revealed\\r\\nnothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife, the handle of\\r\\nwhich bore copious traces of recent blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right,” said Lestrade, as we parted. “Hill knows all these\\r\\ngentry, and he will give a name to him. You’ll find that my theory of\\r\\nthe Mafia will work out all right. But I’m sure I am exceedingly obliged\\r\\nto you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon\\r\\nhim. I don’t quite understand it all yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off, and\\r\\nit is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end.\\r\\nIf you will come round once more to my rooms at six o’clock to-morrow, I\\r\\nthink I shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the\\r\\nentire meaning of this business, which presents some features which make\\r\\nit absolutely original in the history of crime. If ever I permit you\\r\\nto chronicle any more of my little problems, Watson, I foresee that you\\r\\nwill enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the\\r\\nNapoleonic busts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we met again next evening, Lestrade was furnished with much\\r\\ninformation concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was Beppo,\\r\\nsecond name unknown. He was a well-known ne’er-do-well among the Italian\\r\\ncolony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest\\r\\nliving, but he had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in\\r\\njail--once for a petty theft, and once, as we had already heard, for\\r\\nstabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk English perfectly well. His\\r\\nreasons for destroying the busts were still unknown, and he refused to\\r\\nanswer any questions upon the subject, but the police had discovered\\r\\nthat these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands,\\r\\nsince he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of\\r\\nGelder & Co. To all this information, much of which we already knew,\\r\\nHolmes listened with polite attention, but I, who knew him so well,\\r\\ncould clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a\\r\\nmixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which\\r\\nhe was wont to assume. At last he started in his chair, and his eyes\\r\\nbrightened. There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard\\r\\nsteps upon the stairs, and an elderly red-faced man with grizzled\\r\\nside-whiskers was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an\\r\\nold-fashioned carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend bowed and smiled. “Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?” said\\r\\nhe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late, but the trains were awkward.\\r\\nYou wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have your letter here. You said, ‘I desire to possess a copy of\\r\\nDevine’s Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one\\r\\nwhich is in your possession.’ Is that right?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine how\\r\\nyou knew that I owned such a thing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very\\r\\nsimple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you\\r\\ntheir last copy, and he gave me your address.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he did not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only gave\\r\\nfifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that\\r\\nbefore I take ten pounds from you.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have named\\r\\nthat price, so I intend to stick to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up\\r\\nwith me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!” He opened his bag, and at\\r\\nlast we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which\\r\\nwe had already seen more than once in fragments.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon the\\r\\ntable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of\\r\\nthese witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible\\r\\nright that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you\\r\\nsee, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank\\r\\nyou, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good\\r\\nevening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our visitor had disappeared, Sherlock Holmes’s movements were such\\r\\nas to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white cloth from\\r\\na drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his newly acquired\\r\\nbust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up his hunting-crop\\r\\nand struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head. The figure\\r\\nbroke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over the shattered\\r\\nremains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph he held up one\\r\\nsplinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a plum in a\\r\\npudding.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, “let me introduce you to the famous black pearl\\r\\nof the Borgias.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous\\r\\nimpulse, we both broke at clapping, as at the well-wrought crisis of a\\r\\nplay. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes’s pale cheeks, and he bowed to\\r\\nus like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience.\\r\\nIt was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning\\r\\nmachine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause. The\\r\\nsame singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain\\r\\nfrom popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by\\r\\nspontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, gentlemen,” said he, “it is the most famous pearl now existing\\r\\nin the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain of\\r\\ninductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna’s bedroom at\\r\\nthe Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of this, the last\\r\\nof the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured by Gelder & Co.,\\r\\nof Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the sensation caused by the\\r\\ndisappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the London\\r\\npolice to recover it. I was myself consulted upon the case, but I was\\r\\nunable to throw any light upon it. Suspicion fell upon the maid of the\\r\\nPrincess, who was an Italian, and it was proved that she had a brother\\r\\nin London, but we failed to trace any connection between them. The\\r\\nmaid’s name was Lucretia Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that\\r\\nthis Pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been\\r\\nlooking up the dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the\\r\\ndisappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of\\r\\nBeppo, for some crime of violence--an event which took place in the\\r\\nfactory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were being\\r\\nmade. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you see them,\\r\\nof course, in the inverse order to the way in which they presented\\r\\nthemselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He may have\\r\\nstolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro’s confederate, he\\r\\nmay have been the go-between of Pietro and his sister. It is of no\\r\\nconsequence to us which is the correct solution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The main fact is that he HAD the pearl, and at that moment, when it was\\r\\non his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the factory in\\r\\nwhich he worked, and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to\\r\\nconceal this enormously valuable prize, which would otherwise be found\\r\\non him when he was searched. Six plaster casts of Napoleon were drying\\r\\nin the passage. One of them was still soft. In an instant Beppo, a\\r\\nskilful workman, made a small hole in the wet plaster, dropped in the\\r\\npearl, and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more. It\\r\\nwas an admirable hiding-place. No one could possibly find it. But Beppo\\r\\nwas condemned to a year’s imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six\\r\\nbusts were scattered over London. He could not tell which contained his\\r\\ntreasure. Only by breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell\\r\\nhim nothing, for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl\\r\\nwould adhere to it--as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and\\r\\nhe conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance.\\r\\nThrough a cousin who works with Gelder, he found out the retail firms\\r\\nwho had bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse\\r\\nHudson, and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not\\r\\nthere. Then, with the help of some Italian employee, he succeeded in\\r\\nfinding out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at\\r\\nHarker’s. There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo\\r\\nresponsible for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle\\r\\nwhich followed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he was his confederate, why should he carry his photograph?” I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“As a means of tracing him, if he wished to inquire about him from any\\r\\nthird person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder\\r\\nI calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his\\r\\nmovements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and so\\r\\nhe hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I could\\r\\nnot say that he had not found the pearl in Harker’s bust. I had not even\\r\\nconcluded for certain that it was the pearl, but it was evident to me\\r\\nthat he was looking for something, since he carried the bust past\\r\\nthe other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp\\r\\noverlooking it. Since Harker’s bust was one in three, the chances were\\r\\nexactly as I told you--two to one against the pearl being inside it.\\r\\nThere remained two busts, and it was obvious that he would go for the\\r\\nLondon one first. I warned the inmates of the house, so as to avoid a\\r\\nsecond tragedy, and we went down, with the happiest results. By that\\r\\ntime, of course, I knew for certain that it was the Borgia pearl that we\\r\\nwere after. The name of the murdered man linked the one event with the\\r\\nother. There only remained a single bust--the Reading one--and the pearl\\r\\nmust be there. I bought it in your presence from the owner--and there it\\r\\nlies.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe sat in silence for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said Lestrade, “I’ve seen you handle a good many cases, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, but I don’t know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than\\r\\nthat. We’re not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very\\r\\nproud of you, and if you come down to-morrow, there’s not a man, from\\r\\nthe oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn’t be glad to\\r\\nshake you by the hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you!” said Holmes. “Thank you!” and as he turned away, it seemed\\r\\nto me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I\\r\\nhad ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and practical thinker\\r\\nonce more. “Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,” said he, “and get out\\r\\nthe papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case. Good-bye, Lestrade. If\\r\\nany little problem comes your way, I shall be happy, if I can, to give\\r\\nyou a hint or two as to its solution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the year ‘95 that a combination of events, into which I need\\r\\nnot enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some weeks in\\r\\none of our great university towns, and it was during this time that the\\r\\nsmall but instructive adventure which I am about to relate befell us. It\\r\\nwill be obvious that any details which would help the reader exactly to\\r\\nidentify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive.\\r\\nSo painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion\\r\\nthe incident itself may, however, be described, since it serves to\\r\\nillustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable.\\r\\nI will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve\\r\\nto limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the\\r\\npeople concerned.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library\\r\\nwhere Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early\\r\\nEnglish charters--researches which led to results so striking that they\\r\\nmay be the subject of one of my future narratives. Here it was that one\\r\\nevening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton Soames,\\r\\ntutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke’s. Mr. Soames was a tall,\\r\\nspare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had always known\\r\\nhim to be restless in his manner, but on this particular occasion he was\\r\\nin such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something\\r\\nvery unusual had occurred.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable\\r\\ntime. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke’s, and really, but\\r\\nfor the happy chance of your being in town, I should have been at a loss\\r\\nwhat to do.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions,” my friend\\r\\nanswered. “I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the\\r\\npolice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once the\\r\\nlaw is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of those\\r\\ncases where, for the credit of the college, it is most essential to\\r\\navoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your powers, and you\\r\\nare the one man in the world who can help me. I beg you, Mr. Holmes, to\\r\\ndo what you can.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend’s temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the\\r\\ncongenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without his scrapbooks, his\\r\\nchemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. He\\r\\nshrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor\\r\\nin hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his\\r\\nstory.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day\\r\\nof the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the\\r\\nexaminers. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists of\\r\\na large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not seen.\\r\\nThis passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would naturally\\r\\nbe an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance.\\r\\nFor this reason, great care is taken to keep the paper secret.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-day, about three o’clock, the proofs of this paper arrived from the\\r\\nprinters. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I had\\r\\nto read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct. At\\r\\nfour-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had, however, promised to\\r\\ntake tea in a friend’s rooms, so I left the proof upon my desk. I was\\r\\nabsent rather more than an hour.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double--a green\\r\\nbaize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached my outer\\r\\ndoor, I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I imagined that I\\r\\nhad left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I found that it was\\r\\nall right. The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that\\r\\nwhich belonged to my servant, Bannister--a man who has looked after my\\r\\nroom for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. I\\r\\nfound that the key was indeed his, that he had entered my room to know\\r\\nif I wanted tea, and that he had very carelessly left the key in the\\r\\ndoor when he came out. His visit to my room must have been within a very\\r\\nfew minutes of my leaving it. His forgetfulness about the key would\\r\\nhave mattered little upon any other occasion, but on this one day it has\\r\\nproduced the most deplorable consequences.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged\\r\\namong my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all\\r\\ntogether. Now, I found that one of them was lying on the floor, one was\\r\\non the side table near the window, and the third was where I had left\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes stirred for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third where\\r\\nyou left it,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray continue your very interesting statement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable\\r\\nliberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the utmost\\r\\nearnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the truth. The\\r\\nalternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door,\\r\\nhad known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers. A large\\r\\nsum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a very valuable one,\\r\\nand an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an\\r\\nadvantage over his fellows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had nearly fainted\\r\\nwhen we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. I gave\\r\\nhim a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a\\r\\nmost careful examination of the room. I soon saw that the intruder had\\r\\nleft other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers. On the\\r\\ntable in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been\\r\\nsharpened. A broken tip of lead was lying there also. Evidently the\\r\\nrascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had broken his pencil, and\\r\\nhad been compelled to put a fresh point to it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his\\r\\nattention became more engrossed by the case. “Fortune has been your\\r\\nfriend.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of red\\r\\nleather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was\\r\\nsmooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three inches\\r\\nlong--not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this, but on\\r\\nthe table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of\\r\\nsomething which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced that these\\r\\nmarks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There were no\\r\\nfootmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at my wit’s\\r\\nend, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the\\r\\ntown, and I came straight round to put the matter into your hands. Do\\r\\nhelp me, Mr. Holmes. You see my dilemma. Either I must find the man or\\r\\nelse the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared,\\r\\nand since this cannot be done without explanation, there will ensue a\\r\\nhideous scandal, which will throw a cloud not only on the college,\\r\\nbut on the university. Above all things, I desire to settle the matter\\r\\nquietly and discreetly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I\\r\\ncan,” said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. “The case is not\\r\\nentirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited you in your room after\\r\\nthe papers came to you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, young Daulat Ras, an Indian student, who lives on the same stair,\\r\\ncame in to ask me some particulars about the examination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“For which he was entered?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the papers were on your table?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the best of my belief, they were rolled up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But might be recognized as proofs?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Possibly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one else in your room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did anyone know that these proofs would be there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one save the printer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did this man Bannister know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, certainly not. No one knew.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where is Bannister now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was very ill, poor fellow. I left him collapsed in the chair. I was\\r\\nin such a hurry to come to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You left your door open?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I locked up the papers first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it amounts to this, Mr. Soames: that, unless the Indian student\\r\\nrecognized the roll as being proofs, the man who tampered with them came\\r\\nupon them accidentally without knowing that they were there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it seems to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes gave an enigmatic smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said he, “let us go round. Not one of your cases,\\r\\nWatson--mental, not physical. All right; come if you want to. Now, Mr.\\r\\nSoames--at your disposal!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sitting-room of our client opened by a long, low, latticed window on\\r\\nto the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college. A Gothic arched\\r\\ndoor led to a worn stone staircase. On the ground floor was the tutor’s\\r\\nroom. Above were three students, one on each story. It was already\\r\\ntwilight when we reached the scene of our problem. Holmes halted and\\r\\nlooked earnestly at the window. Then he approached it, and, standing on\\r\\ntiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must have entered through the door. There is no opening except the\\r\\none pane,” said our learned guide.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” said Holmes, and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced\\r\\nat our companion. “Well, if there is nothing to be learned here, we had\\r\\nbest go inside.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room. We\\r\\nstood at the entrance while Holmes made an examination of the carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am afraid there are no signs here,” said he. “One could hardly hope\\r\\nfor any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to have quite recovered.\\r\\nYou left him in a chair, you say. Which chair?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the window there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. Near this little table. You can come in now. I have finished\\r\\nwith the carpet. Let us take the little table first. Of course, what has\\r\\nhappened is very clear. The man entered and took the papers, sheet by\\r\\nsheet, from the central table. He carried them over to the window table,\\r\\nbecause from there he could see if you came across the courtyard, and so\\r\\ncould effect an escape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As a matter of fact, he could not,” said Soames, “for I entered by the\\r\\nside door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that’s good! Well, anyhow, that was in his mind. Let me see the\\r\\nthree strips. No finger impressions--no! Well, he carried over this one\\r\\nfirst, and he copied it. How long would it take him to do that, using\\r\\nevery possible contraction? A quarter of an hour, not less. Then he\\r\\ntossed it down and seized the next. He was in the midst of that when\\r\\nyour return caused him to make a very hurried retreat--VERY hurried,\\r\\nsince he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he\\r\\nhad been there. You were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as\\r\\nyou entered the outer door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I can’t say I was.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil, and had, as you\\r\\nobserve, to sharpen it again. This is of interest, Watson. The pencil\\r\\nwas not an ordinary one. It was above the usual size, with a soft lead,\\r\\nthe outer colour was dark blue, the maker’s name was printed in silver\\r\\nlettering, and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half\\r\\nlong. Look for such a pencil, Mr. Soames, and you have got your man.\\r\\nWhen I add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife, you have an\\r\\nadditional aid.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information. “I can\\r\\nfollow the other points,” said he, “but really, in this matter of the\\r\\nlength----”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear\\r\\nwood after them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I fear that even now----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others. What\\r\\ncould this NN be? It is at the end of a word. You are aware that Johann\\r\\nFaber is the most common maker’s name. Is it not clear that there is\\r\\njust as much of the pencil left as usually follows the Johann?” He held\\r\\nthe small table sideways to the electric light. “I was hoping that\\r\\nif the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come\\r\\nthrough upon this polished surface. No, I see nothing. I don’t think\\r\\nthere is anything more to be learned here. Now for the central table.\\r\\nThis small pellet is, I presume, the black, doughy mass you spoke of.\\r\\nRoughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out, I perceive. As you say,\\r\\nthere appear to be grains of sawdust in it. Dear me, this is very\\r\\ninteresting. And the cut--a positive tear, I see. It began with a\\r\\nthin scratch and ended in a jagged hole. I am much indebted to you for\\r\\ndirecting my attention to this case, Mr. Soames. Where does that door\\r\\nlead to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To my bedroom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you been in it since your adventure?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I came straight away for you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to have a glance round. What a charming, old-fashioned\\r\\nroom! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until I have examined the\\r\\nfloor. No, I see nothing. What about this curtain? You hang your clothes\\r\\nbehind it. If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must\\r\\ndo it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No\\r\\none there, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and\\r\\nalertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency. As a\\r\\nmatter of fact, the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four\\r\\nsuits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs. Holmes turned away, and\\r\\nstooped suddenly to the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Halloa! What’s this?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a small pyramid of black, putty-like stuff, exactly like the one\\r\\nupon the table of the study. Holmes held it out on his open palm in the\\r\\nglare of the electric light.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in\\r\\nyour sitting-room, Mr. Soames.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What could he have wanted there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it is clear enough. You came back by an unexpected way, and so\\r\\nhe had no warning until you were at the very door. What could he do?\\r\\nHe caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your\\r\\nbedroom to conceal himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good gracious, Mr. Holmes, do you mean to tell me that, all the time I\\r\\nwas talking to Bannister in this room, we had the man prisoner if we had\\r\\nonly known it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I read it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely there is another alternative, Mr. Holmes. I don’t know whether\\r\\nyou observed my bedroom window?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Lattice-paned, lead framework, three separate windows, one swinging on\\r\\nhinge, and large enough to admit a man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. And it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be\\r\\npartly invisible. The man might have effected his entrance there, left\\r\\ntraces as he passed through the bedroom, and finally, finding the door\\r\\nopen, have escaped that way.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head impatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us be practical,” said he. “I understand you to say that there are\\r\\nthree students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your\\r\\ndoor?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there are.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And they are all in for this examination?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSoames hesitated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a very delicate question,” said he. “One hardly likes to throw\\r\\nsuspicion where there are no proofs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you, then, in a few words the character of the three men\\r\\nwho inhabit these rooms. The lower of the three is Gilchrist, a fine\\r\\nscholar and athlete, plays in the Rugby team and the cricket team for\\r\\nthe college, and got his Blue for the hurdles and the long jump. He is\\r\\na fine, manly fellow. His father was the notorious Sir Jabez Gilchrist,\\r\\nwho ruined himself on the turf. My scholar has been left very poor, but\\r\\nhe is hard-working and industrious. He will do well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The second floor is inhabited by Daulat Ras, the Indian. He is a quiet,\\r\\ninscrutable fellow; as most of those Indians are. He is well up in his\\r\\nwork, though his Greek is his weak subject. He is steady and methodical.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The top floor belongs to Miles McLaren. He is a brilliant fellow when\\r\\nhe chooses to work--one of the brightest intellects of the university;\\r\\nbut he is wayward, dissipated, and unprincipled. He was nearly expelled\\r\\nover a card scandal in his first year. He has been idling all this term,\\r\\nand he must look forward with dread to the examination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it is he whom you suspect?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the\\r\\nleast unlikely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. Now, Mr. Soames, let us have a look at your servant,\\r\\nBannister.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was a little, white-faced, clean-shaven, grizzly-haired fellow of\\r\\nfifty. He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet\\r\\nroutine of his life. His plump face was twitching with his nervousness,\\r\\nand his fingers could not keep still.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are investigating this unhappy business, Bannister,” said his\\r\\nmaster.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand,” said Holmes, “that you left your key in the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day\\r\\nwhen there were these papers inside?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was most unfortunate, sir. But I have occasionally done the same\\r\\nthing at other times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When did you enter the room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was about half-past four. That is Mr. Soames’ tea time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long did you stay?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I saw that he was absent, I withdrew at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you look at these papers on the table?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir--certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How came you to leave the key in the door?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had the tea-tray in my hand. I thought I would come back for the key.\\r\\nThen I forgot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Has the outer door a spring lock?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it was open all the time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyone in the room could get out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Mr. Soames returned and called for you, you were very much\\r\\ndisturbed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. Such a thing has never happened during the many years that I\\r\\nhave been here. I nearly fainted, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I understand. Where were you when you began to feel bad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was I, sir? Why, here, near the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is singular, because you sat down in that chair over yonder near\\r\\nthe corner. Why did you pass these other chairs?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, sir, it didn’t matter to me where I sat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really don’t think he knew much about it, Mr. Holmes. He was looking\\r\\nvery bad--quite ghastly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You stayed here when your master left?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Only for a minute or so. Then I locked the door and went to my room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom do you suspect?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I would not venture to say, sir. I don’t believe there is any\\r\\ngentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an\\r\\naction. No, sir, I’ll not believe it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, that will do,” said Holmes. “Oh, one more word. You have not\\r\\nmentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is\\r\\namiss?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir--not a word.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You haven’t seen any of them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Now, Mr. Soames, we will take a walk in the quadrangle, if\\r\\nyou please.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThree yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your three birds are all in their nests,” said Holmes, looking up.\\r\\n“Halloa! What’s that? One of them seems restless enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his\\r\\nblind. He was pacing swiftly up and down his room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to have a peep at each of them,” said Holmes. “Is it\\r\\npossible?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No difficulty in the world,” Soames answered. “This set of rooms is\\r\\nquite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to\\r\\ngo over them. Come along, and I will personally conduct you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No names, please!” said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist’s door. A\\r\\ntall, flaxen-haired, slim young fellow opened it, and made us welcome\\r\\nwhen he understood our errand. There were some really curious pieces of\\r\\nmediaeval domestic architecture within. Holmes was so charmed with\\r\\none of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook, broke his\\r\\npencil, had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to\\r\\nsharpen his own. The same curious accident happened to him in the rooms\\r\\nof the Indian--a silent, little, hook-nosed fellow, who eyed us askance,\\r\\nand was obviously glad when Holmes’s architectural studies had come to\\r\\nan end. I could not see that in either case Holmes had come upon the\\r\\nclue for which he was searching. Only at the third did our visit prove\\r\\nabortive. The outer door would not open to our knock, and nothing more\\r\\nsubstantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it. “I\\r\\ndon’t care who you are. You can go to blazes!” roared the angry voice.\\r\\n“Tomorrow’s the exam, and I won’t be drawn by anyone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A rude fellow,” said our guide, flushing with anger as we withdrew\\r\\ndown the stair. “Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was\\r\\nknocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and,\\r\\nindeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s response was a curious one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you tell me his exact height?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Really, Mr. Holmes, I cannot undertake to say. He is taller than the\\r\\nIndian, not so tall as Gilchrist. I suppose five foot six would be about\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is very important,” said Holmes. “And now, Mr. Soames, I wish you\\r\\ngood-night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay. “Good gracious,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion!\\r\\nYou don’t seem to realize the position. To-morrow is the examination. I\\r\\nmust take some definite action to-night. I cannot allow the examination\\r\\nto be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. The situation\\r\\nmust be faced.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must leave it as it is. I shall drop round early to-morrow morning\\r\\nand chat the matter over. It is possible that I may be in a position\\r\\nthen to indicate some course of action. Meanwhile, you change\\r\\nnothing--nothing at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can be perfectly easy in your mind. We shall certainly find some\\r\\nway out of your difficulties. I will take the black clay with me, also\\r\\nthe pencil cuttings. Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked\\r\\nup at the windows. The Indian still paced his room. The others were\\r\\ninvisible.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson, what do you think of it?” Holmes asked, as we came out\\r\\ninto the main street. “Quite a little parlour game--sort of three-card\\r\\ntrick, is it not? There are your three men. It must be one of them. You\\r\\ntake your choice. Which is yours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The foul-mouthed fellow at the top. He is the one with the worst\\r\\nrecord. And yet that Indian was a sly fellow also. Why should he be\\r\\npacing his room all the time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing in that. Many men do it when they are trying to learn\\r\\nanything by heart.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He looked at us in a queer way.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So would you, if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were\\r\\npreparing for an examination next day, and every moment was of\\r\\nvalue. No, I see nothing in that. Pencils, too, and knives--all was\\r\\nsatisfactory. But that fellow DOES puzzle me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Bannister, the servant. What’s his game in the matter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He impressed me as being a perfectly honest man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So he did me. That’s the puzzling part. Why should a perfectly\\r\\nhonest man--Well, well, here’s a large stationer’s. We shall begin our\\r\\nresearches here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were only four stationers of any consequences in the town, and at\\r\\neach Holmes produced his pencil chips, and bid high for a duplicate. All\\r\\nwere agreed that one could be ordered, but that it was not a usual size\\r\\nof pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock. My friend did not\\r\\nappear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in\\r\\nhalf-humorous resignation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No good, my dear Watson. This, the best and only final clue, has run\\r\\nto nothing. But, indeed, I have little doubt that we can build up a\\r\\nsufficient case without it. By Jove! my dear fellow, it is nearly nine,\\r\\nand the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty. What with your\\r\\neternal tobacco, Watson, and your irregularity at meals, I expect that\\r\\nyou will get notice to quit, and that I shall share your downfall--not,\\r\\nhowever, before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor, the\\r\\ncareless servant, and the three enterprising students.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes made no further allusion to the matter that day, though he sat\\r\\nlost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner. At eight in\\r\\nthe morning, he came into my room just as I finished my toilet.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson,” said he, “it is time we went down to St. Luke’s. Can you\\r\\ndo without breakfast?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him\\r\\nsomething positive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you anything positive to tell him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have formed a conclusion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, my dear Watson, I have solved the mystery.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But what fresh evidence could you have got?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Aha! It is not for nothing that I have turned myself out of bed at the\\r\\nuntimely hour of six. I have put in two hours’ hard work and covered at\\r\\nleast five miles, with something to show for it. Look at that!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held out his hand. On the palm were three little pyramids of black,\\r\\ndoughy clay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Holmes, you had only two yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And one more this morning. It is a fair argument that wherever No. 3\\r\\ncame from is also the source of Nos. 1 and 2. Eh, Watson? Well, come\\r\\nalong and put friend Soames out of his pain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation\\r\\nwhen we found him in his chambers. In a few hours the examination would\\r\\ncommence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts\\r\\npublic and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.\\r\\nHe could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he\\r\\nran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank heaven that you have come! I feared that you had given it up in\\r\\ndespair. What am I to do? Shall the examination proceed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, let it proceed, by all means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But this rascal?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He shall not compete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think so. If this matter is not to become public, we must give\\r\\nourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private\\r\\ncourt-martial. You there, if you please, Soames! Watson you here! I’ll\\r\\ntake the armchair in the middle. I think that we are now sufficiently\\r\\nimposing to strike terror into a guilty breast. Kindly ring the bell!”\\r\\n\\r\\nBannister entered, and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our\\r\\njudicial appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will kindly close the door,” said Holmes. “Now, Bannister, will you\\r\\nplease tell us the truth about yesterday’s incident?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man turned white to the roots of his hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have told you everything, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing to add?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing at all, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, I must make some suggestions to you. When you sat down\\r\\non that chair yesterday, did you do so in order to conceal some object\\r\\nwhich would have shown who had been in the room?”\\r\\n\\r\\nBannister’s face was ghastly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is only a suggestion,” said Holmes, suavely. “I frankly admit that\\r\\nI am unable to prove it. But it seems probable enough, since the moment\\r\\nthat Mr. Soames’s back was turned, you released the man who was hiding\\r\\nin that bedroom.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBannister licked his dry lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no man, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that’s a pity, Bannister. Up to now you may have spoken the truth,\\r\\nbut now I know that you have lied.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man’s face set in sullen defiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no man, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, Bannister!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, there was no one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case, you can give us no further information. Would you please\\r\\nremain in the room? Stand over there near the bedroom door. Now, Soames,\\r\\nI am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of\\r\\nyoung Gilchrist, and to ask him to step down into yours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAn instant later the tutor returned, bringing with him the student. He\\r\\nwas a fine figure of a man, tall, lithe, and agile, with a springy step\\r\\nand a pleasant, open face. His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us,\\r\\nand finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in\\r\\nthe farther corner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just close the door,” said Holmes. “Now, Mr. Gilchrist, we are all\\r\\nquite alone here, and no one need ever know one word of what passes\\r\\nbetween us. We can be perfectly frank with each other. We want to know,\\r\\nMr. Gilchrist, how you, an honourable man, ever came to commit such an\\r\\naction as that of yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe unfortunate young man staggered back, and cast a look full of horror\\r\\nand reproach at Bannister.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, Mr. Gilchrist, sir, I never said a word--never one word!” cried\\r\\nthe servant.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, but you have now,” said Holmes. “Now, sir, you must see that after\\r\\nBannister’s words your position is hopeless, and that your only chance\\r\\nlies in a frank confession.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his\\r\\nwrithing features. The next he had thrown himself on his knees beside\\r\\nthe table, and burying his face in his hands, he had burst into a storm\\r\\nof passionate sobbing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come,” said Holmes, kindly, “it is human to err, and at least\\r\\nno one can accuse you of being a callous criminal. Perhaps it would be\\r\\neasier for you if I were to tell Mr. Soames what occurred, and you can\\r\\ncheck me where I am wrong. Shall I do so? Well, well, don’t trouble to\\r\\nanswer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From the moment, Mr. Soames, that you said to me that no one, not even\\r\\nBannister, could have told that the papers were in your room, the case\\r\\nbegan to take a definite shape in my mind. The printer one could, of\\r\\ncourse, dismiss. He could examine the papers in his own office. The\\r\\nIndian I also thought nothing of. If the proofs were in a roll, he\\r\\ncould not possibly know what they were. On the other hand, it seemed an\\r\\nunthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room,\\r\\nand that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table. I\\r\\ndismissed that. The man who entered knew that the papers were there. How\\r\\ndid he know?\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I approached your room, I examined the window. You amused me by\\r\\nsupposing that I was contemplating the possibility of someone having\\r\\nin broad daylight, under the eyes of all these opposite rooms, forced\\r\\nhimself through it. Such an idea was absurd. I was measuring how tall a\\r\\nman would need to be in order to see, as he passed, what papers were on\\r\\nthe central table. I am six feet high, and I could do it with an effort.\\r\\nNo one less than that would have a chance. Already you see I had reason\\r\\nto think that, if one of your three students was a man of unusual\\r\\nheight, he was the most worth watching of the three.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of\\r\\nthe side table. Of the centre table I could make nothing, until in\\r\\nyour description of Gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long-distance\\r\\njumper. Then the whole thing came to me in an instant, and I only needed\\r\\ncertain corroborative proofs, which I speedily obtained.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What happened with {sic} this: This young fellow had employed his\\r\\nafternoon at the athletic grounds, where he had been practising the\\r\\njump. He returned carrying his jumping-shoes, which are provided, as you\\r\\nare aware, with several sharp spikes. As he passed your window he\\r\\nsaw, by means of his great height, these proofs upon your table, and\\r\\nconjectured what they were. No harm would have been done had it not been\\r\\nthat, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left\\r\\nby the carelessness of your servant. A sudden impulse came over him to\\r\\nenter, and see if they were indeed the proofs. It was not a dangerous\\r\\nexploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask\\r\\na question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, when he saw that they were indeed the proofs, it was then that\\r\\nhe yielded to temptation. He put his shoes on the table. What was it you\\r\\nput on that chair near the window?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gloves,” said the young man.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes looked triumphantly at Bannister. “He put his gloves on the\\r\\nchair, and he took the proofs, sheet by sheet, to copy them. He thought\\r\\nthe tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him. As we\\r\\nknow, he came back by the side gate. Suddenly he heard him at the very\\r\\ndoor. There was no possible escape. He forgot his gloves but he caught\\r\\nup his shoes and darted into the bedroom. You observe that the scratch\\r\\non that table is slight at one side, but deepens in the direction of the\\r\\nbedroom door. That in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been\\r\\ndrawn in that direction, and that the culprit had taken refuge there.\\r\\nThe earth round the spike had been left on the table, and a second\\r\\nsample was loosened and fell in the bedroom. I may add that I walked out\\r\\nto the athletic grounds this morning, saw that tenacious black clay is\\r\\nused in the jumping-pit and carried away a specimen of it, together with\\r\\nsome of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the\\r\\nathlete from slipping. Have I told the truth, Mr. Gilchrist?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe student had drawn himself erect.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, it is true,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good heavens! have you nothing to add?” cried Soames.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I have, but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has\\r\\nbewildered me. I have a letter here, Mr. Soames, which I wrote to you\\r\\nearly this morning in the middle of a restless night. It was before I\\r\\nknew that my sin had found me out. Here it is, sir. You will see that I\\r\\nhave said, ‘I have determined not to go in for the examination. I have\\r\\nbeen offered a commission in the Rhodesian Police, and I am going out to\\r\\nSouth Africa at once.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your\\r\\nunfair advantage,” said Soames. “But why did you change your purpose?”\\r\\n\\r\\nGilchrist pointed to Bannister.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is the man who set me in the right path,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come now, Bannister,” said Holmes. “It will be clear to you, from what\\r\\nI have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you\\r\\nwere left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out.\\r\\nAs to his escaping by that window, it was incredible. Can you not clear\\r\\nup the last point in this mystery, and tell us the reasons for your\\r\\naction?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with all your\\r\\ncleverness, it was impossible that you could know. Time was, sir, when\\r\\nI was butler to old Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman’s father.\\r\\nWhen he was ruined I came to the college as servant, but I never forgot\\r\\nmy old employer because he was down in the world. I watched his son all\\r\\nI could for the sake of the old days. Well, sir, when I came into this\\r\\nroom yesterday, when the alarm was given, the very first thing I saw was\\r\\nMr. Gilchrist’s tan gloves a-lying in that chair. I knew those gloves\\r\\nwell, and I understood their message. If Mr. Soames saw them, the game\\r\\nwas up. I flopped down into that chair, and nothing would budge me until\\r\\nMr. Soames he went for you. Then out came my poor young master, whom I\\r\\nhad dandled on my knee, and confessed it all to me. Wasn’t it natural,\\r\\nsir, that I should save him, and wasn’t it natural also that I should\\r\\ntry to speak to him as his dead father would have done, and make him\\r\\nunderstand that he could not profit by such a deed? Could you blame me,\\r\\nsir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed,” said Holmes, heartily, springing to his feet. “Well,\\r\\nSoames, I think we have cleared your little problem up, and our\\r\\nbreakfast awaits us at home. Come, Watson! As to you, sir, I trust that\\r\\na bright future awaits you in Rhodesia. For once you have fallen low.\\r\\nLet us see, in the future, how high you can rise.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE GOLDEN PINCE-NEZ\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our\\r\\nwork for the year 1894, I confess that it is very difficult for me,\\r\\nout of such a wealth of material, to select the cases which are most\\r\\ninteresting in themselves, and at the same time most conducive to a\\r\\ndisplay of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous. As I\\r\\nturn over the pages, I see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red\\r\\nleech and the terrible death of Crosby, the banker. Here also I find\\r\\nan account of the Addleton tragedy, and the singular contents of the\\r\\nancient British barrow. The famous Smith-Mortimer succession case comes\\r\\nalso within this period, and so does the tracking and arrest of Huret,\\r\\nthe Boulevard assassin--an exploit which won for Holmes an autograph\\r\\nletter of thanks from the French President and the Order of the Legion\\r\\nof Honour. Each of these would furnish a narrative, but on the whole\\r\\nI am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of\\r\\ninterest as the episode of Yoxley Old Place, which includes not only the\\r\\nlamentable death of young Willoughby Smith, but also those subsequent\\r\\ndevelopments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the\\r\\ncrime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wild, tempestuous night, towards the close of November.\\r\\nHolmes and I sat together in silence all the evening, he engaged with a\\r\\npowerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon\\r\\na palimpsest, I deep in a recent treatise upon surgery. Outside the\\r\\nwind howled down Baker Street, while the rain beat fiercely against the\\r\\nwindows. It was strange there, in the very depths of the town, with ten\\r\\nmiles of man’s handiwork on every side of us, to feel the iron grip of\\r\\nNature, and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all London\\r\\nwas no more than the molehills that dot the fields. I walked to the\\r\\nwindow, and looked out on the deserted street. The occasional lamps\\r\\ngleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement. A single cab\\r\\nwas splashing its way from the Oxford Street end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson, it’s as well we have not to turn out to-night,” said\\r\\nHolmes, laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest. “I’ve done\\r\\nenough for one sitting. It is trying work for the eyes. So far as I can\\r\\nmake out, it is nothing more exciting than an Abbey’s accounts dating\\r\\nfrom the second half of the fifteenth century. Halloa! halloa! halloa!\\r\\nWhat’s this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse’s\\r\\nhoofs, and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb. The\\r\\ncab which I had seen had pulled up at our door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What can he want?” I ejaculated, as a man stepped out of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Want? He wants us. And we, my poor Watson, want overcoats and cravats\\r\\nand goloshes, and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather.\\r\\nWait a bit, though! There’s the cab off again! There’s hope yet. He’d\\r\\nhave kept it if he had wanted us to come. Run down, my dear fellow, and\\r\\nopen the door, for all virtuous folk have been long in bed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor, I had no\\r\\ndifficulty in recognizing him. It was young Stanley Hopkins, a promising\\r\\ndetective, in whose career Holmes had several times shown a very\\r\\npractical interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is he in?” he asked, eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come up, my dear sir,” said Holmes’s voice from above. “I hope you have\\r\\nno designs upon us such a night as this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective mounted the stairs, and our lamp gleamed upon his shining\\r\\nwaterproof. I helped him out of it, while Holmes knocked a blaze out of\\r\\nthe logs in the grate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, my dear Hopkins, draw up and warm your toes,” said he. “Here’s\\r\\na cigar, and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a\\r\\nlemon, which is good medicine on a night like this. It must be something\\r\\nimportant which has brought you out in such a gale.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is indeed, Mr. Holmes. I’ve had a bustling afternoon, I promise you.\\r\\nDid you see anything of the Yoxley case in the latest editions?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to-day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it was only a paragraph, and all wrong at that, so you have not\\r\\nmissed anything. I haven’t let the grass grow under my feet. It’s down\\r\\nin Kent, seven miles from Chatham and three from the railway line. I\\r\\nwas wired for at 3:15, reached Yoxley Old Place at 5, conducted my\\r\\ninvestigation, was back at Charing Cross by the last train, and straight\\r\\nto you by cab.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which means, I suppose, that you are not quite clear about your case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It means that I can make neither head nor tail of it. So far as I can\\r\\nsee, it is just as tangled a business as ever I handled, and yet at\\r\\nfirst it seemed so simple that one couldn’t go wrong. There’s no motive,\\r\\nMr. Holmes. That’s what bothers me--I can’t put my hand on a motive.\\r\\nHere’s a man dead--there’s no denying that--but, so far as I can see, no\\r\\nreason on earth why anyone should wish him harm.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us hear about it,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got my facts pretty clear,” said Stanley Hopkins. “All I want now\\r\\nis to know what they all mean. The story, so far as I can make it out,\\r\\nis like this. Some years ago this country house, Yoxley Old Place, was\\r\\ntaken by an elderly man, who gave the name of Professor Coram. He was\\r\\nan invalid, keeping his bed half the time, and the other half hobbling\\r\\nround the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the\\r\\ngardener in a Bath chair. He was well liked by the few neighbours who\\r\\ncalled upon him, and he has the reputation down there of being a very\\r\\nlearned man. His household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper,\\r\\nMrs. Marker, and of a maid, Susan Tarlton. These have both been with him\\r\\nsince his arrival, and they seem to be women of excellent character. The\\r\\nprofessor is writing a learned book, and he found it necessary, about\\r\\na year ago, to engage a secretary. The first two that he tried were\\r\\nnot successes, but the third, Mr. Willoughby Smith, a very young man\\r\\nstraight from the university, seems to have been just what his employer\\r\\nwanted. His work consisted in writing all the morning to the professor’s\\r\\ndictation, and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and\\r\\npassages which bore upon the next day’s work. This Willoughby Smith has\\r\\nnothing against him, either as a boy at Uppingham or as a young man at\\r\\nCambridge. I have seen his testimonials, and from the first he was a\\r\\ndecent, quiet, hard-working fellow, with no weak spot in him at all.\\r\\nAnd yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the\\r\\nprofessor’s study under circumstances which can point only to murder.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind howled and screamed at the windows. Holmes and I drew closer to\\r\\nthe fire, while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed\\r\\nhis singular narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If you were to search all England,” said he, “I don’t suppose you could\\r\\nfind a household more self-contained or freer from outside influences.\\r\\nWhole weeks would pass, and not one of them go past the garden gate.\\r\\nThe professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else.\\r\\nYoung Smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood, and lived very much as\\r\\nhis employer did. The two women had nothing to take them from the\\r\\nhouse. Mortimer, the gardener, who wheels the Bath chair, is an army\\r\\npensioner--an old Crimean man of excellent character. He does not live\\r\\nin the house, but in a three-roomed cottage at the other end of the\\r\\ngarden. Those are the only people that you would find within the grounds\\r\\nof Yoxley Old Place. At the same time, the gate of the garden is a\\r\\nhundred yards from the main London to Chatham road. It opens with a\\r\\nlatch, and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now I will give you the evidence of Susan Tarlton, who is the only\\r\\nperson who can say anything positive about the matter. It was in the\\r\\nforenoon, between eleven and twelve. She was engaged at the moment in\\r\\nhanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom. Professor Coram was\\r\\nstill in bed, for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday.\\r\\nThe housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the\\r\\nhouse. Willoughby Smith had been in his bedroom, which he uses as a\\r\\nsitting-room, but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the\\r\\npassage and descend to the study immediately below her. She did not\\r\\nsee him, but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick, firm\\r\\ntread. She did not hear the study door close, but a minute or so later\\r\\nthere was a dreadful cry in the room below. It was a wild, hoarse\\r\\nscream, so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a\\r\\nman or a woman. At the same instant there was a heavy thud, which shook\\r\\nthe old house, and then all was silence. The maid stood petrified for a\\r\\nmoment, and then, recovering her courage, she ran downstairs. The study\\r\\ndoor was shut and she opened it. Inside, young Mr. Willoughby Smith was\\r\\nstretched upon the floor. At first she could see no injury, but as she\\r\\ntried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of\\r\\nhis neck. It was pierced by a very small but very deep wound, which had\\r\\ndivided the carotid artery. The instrument with which the injury had\\r\\nbeen inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him. It was one of those small\\r\\nsealing-wax knives to be found on old-fashioned writing-tables, with\\r\\nan ivory handle and a stiff blade. It was part of the fittings of the\\r\\nprofessor’s own desk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At first the maid thought that young Smith was already dead, but on\\r\\npouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened his eyes\\r\\nfor an instant. ‘The professor,’ he murmured--‘it was she.’ The maid is\\r\\nprepared to swear that those were the exact words. He tried desperately\\r\\nto say something else, and he held his right hand up in the air. Then he\\r\\nfell back dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene, but\\r\\nshe was just too late to catch the young man’s dying words. Leaving\\r\\nSusan with the body, she hurried to the professor’s room. He was sitting\\r\\nup in bed, horribly agitated, for he had heard enough to convince him\\r\\nthat something terrible had occurred. Mrs. Marker is prepared to swear\\r\\nthat the professor was still in his night-clothes, and indeed it was\\r\\nimpossible for him to dress without the help of Mortimer, whose orders\\r\\nwere to come at twelve o’clock. The professor declares that he heard the\\r\\ndistant cry, but that he knows nothing more. He can give no explanation\\r\\nof the young man’s last words, ‘The professor--it was she,’ but imagines\\r\\nthat they were the outcome of delirium. He believes that Willoughby\\r\\nSmith had not an enemy in the world, and can give no reason for the\\r\\ncrime. His first action was to send Mortimer, the gardener, for the\\r\\nlocal police. A little later the chief constable sent for me. Nothing\\r\\nwas moved before I got there, and strict orders were given that no\\r\\none should walk upon the paths leading to the house. It was a splendid\\r\\nchance of putting your theories into practice, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\nThere was really nothing wanting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said my companion, with a somewhat bitter\\r\\nsmile. “Well, let us hear about it. What sort of a job did you make of\\r\\nit?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must ask you first, Mr. Holmes, to glance at this rough plan, which\\r\\nwill give you a general idea of the position of the professor’s study\\r\\nand the various points of the case. It will help you in following my\\r\\ninvestigation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe unfolded the rough chart, which I here reproduce,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nand he laid it across Holmes’s knee. I rose and, standing behind Holmes,\\r\\nstudied it over his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is very rough, of course, and it only deals with the points\\r\\nwhich seem to me to be essential. All the rest you will see later for\\r\\nyourself. Now, first of all, presuming that the assassin entered the\\r\\nhouse, how did he or she come in? Undoubtedly by the garden path and the\\r\\nback door, from which there is direct access to the study. Any other way\\r\\nwould have been exceedingly complicated. The escape must have also been\\r\\nmade along that line, for of the two other exits from the room one was\\r\\nblocked by Susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to\\r\\nthe professor’s bedroom. I therefore directed my attention at once\\r\\nto the garden path, which was saturated with recent rain, and would\\r\\ncertainly show any footmarks.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My examination showed me that I was dealing with a cautious and expert\\r\\ncriminal. No footmarks were to be found on the path. There could be no\\r\\nquestion, however, that someone had passed along the grass border which\\r\\nlines the path, and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a\\r\\ntrack. I could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression,\\r\\nbut the grass was trodden down, and someone had undoubtedly passed. It\\r\\ncould only have been the murderer, since neither the gardener nor anyone\\r\\nelse had been there that morning, and the rain had only begun during the\\r\\nnight.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment,” said Holmes. “Where does this path lead to?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the road.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A hundred yards or so.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At the point where the path passes through the gate, you could surely\\r\\npick up the tracks?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unfortunately, the path was tiled at that point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, on the road itself?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, it was all trodden into mire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tut-tut! Well, then, these tracks upon the grass, were they coming or\\r\\ngoing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was impossible to say. There was never any outline.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A large foot or a small?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You could not distinguish.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes gave an ejaculation of impatience.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since,” said\\r\\nhe. “It will be harder to read now than that palimpsest. Well, well, it\\r\\ncan’t be helped. What did you do, Hopkins, after you had made certain\\r\\nthat you had made certain of nothing?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I made certain of a good deal, Mr. Holmes. I knew that someone\\r\\nhad entered the house cautiously from without. I next examined the\\r\\ncorridor. It is lined with cocoanut matting and had taken no impression\\r\\nof any kind. This brought me into the study itself. It is a scantily\\r\\nfurnished room. The main article is a large writing-table with a fixed\\r\\nbureau. This bureau consists of a double column of drawers, with a\\r\\ncentral small cupboard between them. The drawers were open, the cupboard\\r\\nlocked. The drawers, it seems, were always open, and nothing of value\\r\\nwas kept in them. There were some papers of importance in the cupboard,\\r\\nbut there were no signs that this had been tampered with, and the\\r\\nprofessor assures me that nothing was missing. It is certain that no\\r\\nrobbery has been committed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I come now to the body of the young man. It was found near the bureau,\\r\\nand just to the left of it, as marked upon that chart. The stab was on\\r\\nthe right side of the neck and from behind forward, so that it is almost\\r\\nimpossible that it could have been self-inflicted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unless he fell upon the knife,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. The idea crossed my mind. But we found the knife some feet\\r\\naway from the body, so that seems impossible. Then, of course, there are\\r\\nthe man’s own dying words. And, finally, there was this very important\\r\\npiece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man’s right hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his pocket Stanley Hopkins drew a small paper packet. He unfolded\\r\\nit and disclosed a golden pince-nez, with two broken ends of black\\r\\nsilk cord dangling from the end of it. “Willoughby Smith had excellent\\r\\nsight,” he added. “There can be no question that this was snatched from\\r\\nthe face or the person of the assassin.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes took the glasses into his hand, and examined them with\\r\\nthe utmost attention and interest. He held them on his nose, endeavoured\\r\\nto read through them, went to the window and stared up the street with\\r\\nthem, looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp, and\\r\\nfinally, with a chuckle, seated himself at the table and wrote a few\\r\\nlines upon a sheet of paper, which he tossed across to Stanley Hopkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s the best I can do for you,” said he. “It may prove to be of some\\r\\nuse.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe astonished detective read the note aloud. It ran as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wanted, a woman of good address, attired like a lady. She has a\\r\\nremarkably thick nose, with eyes which are set close upon either side\\r\\nof it. She has a puckered forehead, a peering expression, and probably\\r\\nrounded shoulders. There are indications that she has had recourse to an\\r\\noptician at least twice during the last few months. As her glasses are\\r\\nof remarkable strength, and as opticians are not very numerous, there\\r\\nshould be no difficulty in tracing her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled at the astonishment of Hopkins, which must have been\\r\\nreflected upon my features. “Surely my deductions are simplicity\\r\\nitself,” said he. “It would be difficult to name any articles which\\r\\nafford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses, especially\\r\\nso remarkable a pair as these. That they belong to a woman I infer from\\r\\ntheir delicacy, and also, of course, from the last words of the dying\\r\\nman. As to her being a person of refinement and well dressed, they\\r\\nare, as you perceive, handsomely mounted in solid gold, and it is\\r\\ninconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in\\r\\nother respects. You will find that the clips are too wide for your nose,\\r\\nshowing that the lady’s nose was very broad at the base. This sort of\\r\\nnose is usually a short and coarse one, but there is a sufficient number\\r\\nof exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon\\r\\nthis point in my description. My own face is a narrow one, and yet I\\r\\nfind that I cannot get my eyes into the centre, nor near the centre, of\\r\\nthese glasses. Therefore, the lady’s eyes are set very near to the sides\\r\\nof the nose. You will perceive, Watson, that the glasses are concave\\r\\nand of unusual strength. A lady whose vision has been so extremely\\r\\ncontracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics\\r\\nof such vision, which are seen in the forehead, the eyelids, and the\\r\\nshoulders.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” I said, “I can follow each of your arguments. I confess, however,\\r\\nthat I am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the\\r\\noptician.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took the glasses in his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will perceive,” he said, “that the clips are lined with tiny\\r\\nbands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose. One of these is\\r\\ndiscoloured and worn to some slight extent, but the other is new.\\r\\nEvidently one has fallen off and been replaced. I should judge that the\\r\\nolder of them has not been there more than a few months. They\\r\\nexactly correspond, so I gather that the lady went back to the same\\r\\nestablishment for the second.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By George, it’s marvellous!” cried Hopkins, in an ecstasy of\\r\\nadmiration. “To think that I had all that evidence in my hand and\\r\\nnever knew it! I had intended, however, to go the round of the London\\r\\nopticians.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course you would. Meanwhile, have you anything more to tell us about\\r\\nthe case?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing, Mr. Holmes. I think that you know as much as I do\\r\\nnow--probably more. We have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen\\r\\non the country roads or at the railway station. We have heard of none.\\r\\nWhat beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime. Not a ghost\\r\\nof a motive can anyone suggest.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! there I am not in a position to help you. But I suppose you want us\\r\\nto come out to-morrow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If it is not asking too much, Mr. Holmes. There’s a train from Charing\\r\\nCross to Chatham at six in the morning, and we should be at Yoxley Old\\r\\nPlace between eight and nine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then we shall take it. Your case has certainly some features of great\\r\\ninterest, and I shall be delighted to look into it. Well, it’s nearly\\r\\none, and we had best get a few hours’ sleep. I daresay you can manage\\r\\nall right on the sofa in front of the fire. I’ll light my spirit lamp,\\r\\nand give you a cup of coffee before we start.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gale had blown itself out next day, but it was a bitter morning when\\r\\nwe started upon our journey. We saw the cold winter sun rise over the\\r\\ndreary marshes of the Thames and the long, sullen reaches of the river,\\r\\nwhich I shall ever associate with our pursuit of the Andaman Islander\\r\\nin the earlier days of our career. After a long and weary journey, we\\r\\nalighted at a small station some miles from Chatham. While a horse was\\r\\nbeing put into a trap at the local inn, we snatched a hurried breakfast,\\r\\nand so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at Yoxley\\r\\nOld Place. A constable met us at the garden gate.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Wilson, any news?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir--nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No reports of any stranger seen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir. Down at the station they are certain that no stranger either\\r\\ncame or went yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir: there is no one that we cannot account for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s only a reasonable walk to Chatham. Anyone might stay there\\r\\nor take a train without being observed. This is the garden path of\\r\\nwhich I spoke, Mr. Holmes. I’ll pledge my word there was no mark on it\\r\\nyesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On which side were the marks on the grass?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This side, sir. This narrow margin of grass between the path and the\\r\\nflower-bed. I can’t see the traces now, but they were clear to me then.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes: someone has passed along,” said Holmes, stooping over the\\r\\ngrass border. “Our lady must have picked her steps carefully, must she\\r\\nnot, since on the one side she would leave a track on the path, and on\\r\\nthe other an even clearer one on the soft bed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, she must have been a cool hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw an intent look pass over Holmes’s face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You say that she must have come back this way?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, there is no other.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On this strip of grass?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! It was a very remarkable performance--very remarkable. Well, I\\r\\nthink we have exhausted the path. Let us go farther. This garden door is\\r\\nusually kept open, I suppose? Then this visitor had nothing to do but\\r\\nto walk in. The idea of murder was not in her mind, or she would have\\r\\nprovided herself with some sort of weapon, instead of having to pick\\r\\nthis knife off the writing-table. She advanced along this corridor,\\r\\nleaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting. Then she found herself in\\r\\nthis study. How long was she there? We have no means of judging.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not more than a few minutes, sir. I forgot to tell you that Mrs.\\r\\nMarker, the housekeeper, had been in there tidying not very long\\r\\nbefore--about a quarter of an hour, she says.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, that gives us a limit. Our lady enters this room, and what does\\r\\nshe do? She goes over to the writing-table. What for? Not for anything\\r\\nin the drawers. If there had been anything worth her taking, it would\\r\\nsurely have been locked up. No, it was for something in that wooden\\r\\nbureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it? Just hold a\\r\\nmatch, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe mark which he was examining began upon the brass-work on the\\r\\nright-hand side of the keyhole, and extended for about four inches,\\r\\nwhere it had scratched the varnish from the surface.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I noticed it, Mr. Holmes, but you’ll always find scratches round a\\r\\nkeyhole.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is recent, quite recent. See how the brass shines where it is\\r\\ncut. An old scratch would be the same colour as the surface. Look at it\\r\\nthrough my lens. There’s the varnish, too, like earth on each side of a\\r\\nfurrow. Is Mrs. Marker there?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA sad-faced, elderly woman came into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you dust this bureau yesterday morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you notice this scratch?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, I did not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sure you did not, for a duster would have swept away these shreds\\r\\nof varnish. Who has the key of this bureau?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Professor keeps it on his watch-chain.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it a simple key?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, it is a Chubb’s key.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good. Mrs. Marker, you can go. Now we are making a little\\r\\nprogress. Our lady enters the room, advances to the bureau, and either\\r\\nopens it or tries to do so. While she is thus engaged, young Willoughby\\r\\nSmith enters the room. In her hurry to withdraw the key, she makes this\\r\\nscratch upon the door. He seizes her, and she, snatching up the nearest\\r\\nobject, which happens to be this knife, strikes at him in order to make\\r\\nhim let go his hold. The blow is a fatal one. He falls and she escapes,\\r\\neither with or without the object for which she has come. Is Susan, the\\r\\nmaid, there? Could anyone have got away through that door after the time\\r\\nthat you heard the cry, Susan?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No sir, it is impossible. Before I got down the stair, I’d have seen\\r\\nanyone in the passage. Besides, the door never opened, or I would have\\r\\nheard it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That settles this exit. Then no doubt the lady went out the way she\\r\\ncame. I understand that this other passage leads only to the professor’s\\r\\nroom. There is no exit that way?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor. Halloa,\\r\\nHopkins! this is very important, very important indeed. The professor’s\\r\\ncorridor is also lined with cocoanut matting.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir, what of that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you see any bearing upon the case? Well, well. I don’t insist\\r\\nupon it. No doubt I am wrong. And yet it seems to me to be suggestive.\\r\\nCome with me and introduce me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe passed down the passage, which was of the same length as that which\\r\\nled to the garden. At the end was a short flight of steps ending in\\r\\na door. Our guide knocked, and then ushered us into the professor’s\\r\\nbedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very large chamber, lined with innumerable volumes, which had\\r\\noverflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners, or were\\r\\nstacked all round at the base of the cases. The bed was in the centre\\r\\nof the room, and in it, propped up with pillows, was the owner of the\\r\\nhouse. I have seldom seen a more remarkable-looking person. It was a\\r\\ngaunt, aquiline face which was turned towards us, with piercing dark\\r\\neyes, which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows. His\\r\\nhair and beard were white, save that the latter was curiously stained\\r\\nwith yellow around his mouth. A cigarette glowed amid the tangle of\\r\\nwhite hair, and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco smoke.\\r\\nAs he held out his hand to Holmes, I perceived that it was also stained\\r\\nwith yellow nicotine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A smoker, Mr. Holmes?” said he, speaking in well-chosen English, with\\r\\na curious little mincing accent. “Pray take a cigarette. And you, sir?\\r\\nI can recommend them, for I have them especially prepared by Ionides, of\\r\\nAlexandria. He sends me a thousand at a time, and I grieve to say that I\\r\\nhave to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight. Bad, sir, very bad,\\r\\nbut an old man has few pleasures. Tobacco and my work--that is all that\\r\\nis left to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had lit a cigarette and was shooting little darting glances all\\r\\nover the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tobacco and my work, but now only tobacco,” the old man exclaimed.\\r\\n“Alas! what a fatal interruption! Who could have foreseen such a\\r\\nterrible catastrophe? So estimable a young man! I assure you that, after\\r\\na few months’ training, he was an admirable assistant. What do you think\\r\\nof the matter, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not yet made up my mind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is\\r\\nso dark to us. To a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow\\r\\nis paralyzing. I seem to have lost the faculty of thought. But you are\\r\\na man of action--you are a man of affairs. It is part of the everyday\\r\\nroutine of your life. You can preserve your balance in every emergency.\\r\\nWe are fortunate, indeed, in having you at our side.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old\\r\\nprofessor was talking. I observed that he was smoking with extraordinary\\r\\nrapidity. It was evident that he shared our host’s liking for the fresh\\r\\nAlexandrian cigarettes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, it is a crushing blow,” said the old man. “That is my MAGNUM\\r\\nOPUS--the pile of papers on the side table yonder. It is my analysis of\\r\\nthe documents found in the Coptic monasteries of Syria and Egypt, a work\\r\\nwhich will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion. With my\\r\\nenfeebled health I do not know whether I shall ever be able to complete\\r\\nit, now that my assistant has been taken from me. Dear me! Mr. Holmes,\\r\\nwhy, you are even a quicker smoker than I am myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smiled.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a connoisseur,” said he, taking another cigarette from the\\r\\nbox--his fourth--and lighting it from the stub of that which he had\\r\\nfinished. “I will not trouble you with any lengthy cross-examination,\\r\\nProfessor Coram, since I gather that you were in bed at the time of the\\r\\ncrime, and could know nothing about it. I would only ask this: What\\r\\ndo you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words: ‘The\\r\\nprofessor--it was she’?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professor shook his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Susan is a country girl,” said he, “and you know the incredible\\r\\nstupidity of that class. I fancy that the poor fellow murmured some\\r\\nincoherent delirious words, and that she twisted them into this\\r\\nmeaningless message.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see. You have no explanation yourself of the tragedy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Possibly an accident, possibly--I only breathe it among ourselves--a\\r\\nsuicide. Young men have their hidden troubles--some affair of the heart,\\r\\nperhaps, which we have never known. It is a more probable supposition\\r\\nthan murder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the eyeglasses?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I am only a student--a man of dreams. I cannot explain the\\r\\npractical things of life. But still, we are aware, my friend, that\\r\\nlove-gages may take strange shapes. By all means take another cigarette.\\r\\nIt is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so. A fan, a glove,\\r\\nglasses--who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured\\r\\nwhen a man puts an end to his life? This gentleman speaks of footsteps\\r\\nin the grass, but, after all, it is easy to be mistaken on such a point.\\r\\nAs to the knife, it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as\\r\\nhe fell. It is possible that I speak as a child, but to me it seems that\\r\\nWilloughby Smith has met his fate by his own hand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward, and he continued to\\r\\nwalk up and down for some time, lost in thought and consuming cigarette\\r\\nafter cigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me, Professor Coram,” he said, at last, “what is in that cupboard\\r\\nin the bureau?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing that would help a thief. Family papers, letters from my poor\\r\\nwife, diplomas of universities which have done me honour. Here is the\\r\\nkey. You can look for yourself.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes picked up the key, and looked at it for an instant, then he\\r\\nhanded it back.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I hardly think that it would help me,” said he. “I should prefer\\r\\nto go quietly down to your garden, and turn the whole matter over in my\\r\\nhead. There is something to be said for the theory of suicide which\\r\\nyou have put forward. We must apologize for having intruded upon you,\\r\\nProfessor Coram, and I promise that we won’t disturb you until after\\r\\nlunch. At two o’clock we will come again, and report to you anything\\r\\nwhich may have happened in the interval.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was curiously distrait, and we walked up and down the garden path\\r\\nfor some time in silence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you a clue?” I asked, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It depends upon those cigarettes that I smoked,” said he. “It is\\r\\npossible that I am utterly mistaken. The cigarettes will show me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Holmes,” I exclaimed, “how on earth----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, you may see for yourself. If not, there’s no harm done. Of\\r\\ncourse, we always have the optician clue to fall back upon, but I take\\r\\na short cut when I can get it. Ah, here is the good Mrs. Marker! Let us\\r\\nenjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI may have remarked before that Holmes had, when he liked, a peculiarly\\r\\ningratiating way with women, and that he very readily established terms\\r\\nof confidence with them. In half the time which he had named, he had\\r\\ncaptured the housekeeper’s goodwill and was chatting with her as if he\\r\\nhad known her for years.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes, it is as you say, sir. He does smoke something\\r\\nterrible. All day and sometimes all night, sir. I’ve seen that room of\\r\\na morning--well, sir, you’d have thought it was a London fog. Poor young\\r\\nMr. Smith, he was a smoker also, but not as bad as the professor. His\\r\\nhealth--well, I don’t know that it’s better nor worse for the smoking.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!” said Holmes, “but it kills the appetite.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I don’t know about that, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose the professor eats hardly anything?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, he is variable. I’ll say that for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll wager he took no breakfast this morning, and won’t face his lunch\\r\\nafter all the cigarettes I saw him consume.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you’re out there, sir, as it happens, for he ate a remarkable big\\r\\nbreakfast this morning. I don’t know when I’ve known him make a\\r\\nbetter one, and he’s ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch. I’m\\r\\nsurprised myself, for since I came into that room yesterday and saw\\r\\nyoung Mr. Smith lying there on the floor, I couldn’t bear to look at\\r\\nfood. Well, it takes all sorts to make a world, and the professor hasn’t\\r\\nlet it take his appetite away.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe loitered the morning away in the garden. Stanley Hopkins had gone\\r\\ndown to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had\\r\\nbeen seen by some children on the Chatham Road the previous morning. As\\r\\nto my friend, all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him. I had\\r\\nnever known him handle a case in such a half-hearted fashion. Even the\\r\\nnews brought back by Hopkins that he had found the children, and that\\r\\nthey had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with Holmes’s\\r\\ndescription, and wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses, failed to\\r\\nrouse any sign of keen interest. He was more attentive when Susan, who\\r\\nwaited upon us at lunch, volunteered the information that she believed\\r\\nMr. Smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning, and that he had\\r\\nonly returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred. I could not\\r\\nmyself see the bearing of this incident, but I clearly perceived that\\r\\nHolmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his\\r\\nbrain. Suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch. “Two\\r\\no’clock, gentlemen,” said he. “We must go up and have it out with our\\r\\nfriend, the professor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man had just finished his lunch, and certainly his empty dish\\r\\nbore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had\\r\\ncredited him. He was, indeed, a weird figure as he turned his white mane\\r\\nand his glowing eyes towards us. The eternal cigarette smouldered in his\\r\\nmouth. He had been dressed and was seated in an armchair by the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Mr. Holmes, have you solved this mystery yet?” He shoved the\\r\\nlarge tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my\\r\\ncompanion. Holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment, and between\\r\\nthem they tipped the box over the edge. For a minute or two we were all\\r\\non our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places. When we\\r\\nrose again, I observed Holmes’s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged\\r\\nwith colour. Only at a crisis have I seen those battle-signals flying.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said he, “I have solved it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins and I stared in amazement. Something like a sneer\\r\\nquivered over the gaunt features of the old professor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed! In the garden?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here! When?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This instant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are surely joking, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You compel me to tell you\\r\\nthat this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have forged and tested every link of my chain, Professor Coram, and I\\r\\nam sure that it is sound. What your motives are, or what exact part\\r\\nyou play in this strange business, I am not yet able to say. In a few\\r\\nminutes I shall probably hear it from your own lips. Meanwhile I will\\r\\nreconstruct what is past for your benefit, so that you may know the\\r\\ninformation which I still require.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A lady yesterday entered your study. She came with the intention of\\r\\npossessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau. She\\r\\nhad a key of her own. I have had an opportunity of examining yours, and\\r\\nI do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the\\r\\nvarnish would have produced. You were not an accessory, therefore, and\\r\\nshe came, so far as I can read the evidence, without your knowledge to\\r\\nrob you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professor blew a cloud from his lips. “This is most interesting and\\r\\ninstructive,” said he. “Have you no more to add? Surely, having traced\\r\\nthis lady so far, you can also say what has become of her.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will endeavour to do so. In the first place she was seized by your\\r\\nsecretary, and stabbed him in order to escape. This catastrophe I am\\r\\ninclined to regard as an unhappy accident, for I am convinced that the\\r\\nlady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury. An assassin\\r\\ndoes not come unarmed. Horrified by what she had done, she rushed wildly\\r\\naway from the scene of the tragedy. Unfortunately for her, she had lost\\r\\nher glasses in the scuffle, and as she was extremely short-sighted she\\r\\nwas really helpless without them. She ran down a corridor, which she\\r\\nimagined to be that by which she had come--both were lined with cocoanut\\r\\nmatting--and it was only when it was too late that she understood that\\r\\nshe had taken the wrong passage, and that her retreat was cut off behind\\r\\nher. What was she to do? She could not go back. She could not remain\\r\\nwhere she was. She must go on. She went on. She mounted a stair, pushed\\r\\nopen a door, and found herself in your room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man sat with his mouth open, staring wildly at Holmes. Amazement\\r\\nand fear were stamped upon his expressive features. Now, with an effort,\\r\\nhe shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All very fine, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “But there is one little flaw\\r\\nin your splendid theory. I was myself in my room, and I never left it\\r\\nduring the day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am aware of that, Professor Coram.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you mean to say that I could lie upon that bed and not be aware\\r\\nthat a woman had entered my room?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never said so. You WERE aware of it. You spoke with her. You\\r\\nrecognized her. You aided her to escape.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the professor burst into high-keyed laughter. He had risen to his\\r\\nfeet, and his eyes glowed like embers.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are mad!” he cried. “You are talking insanely. I helped her to\\r\\nescape? Where is she now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She is there,” said Holmes, and he pointed to a high bookcase in the\\r\\ncorner of the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nI saw the old man throw up his arms, a terrible convulsion passed over\\r\\nhis grim face, and he fell back in his chair. At the same instant the\\r\\nbookcase at which Holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge, and a woman\\r\\nrushed out into the room. “You are right!” she cried, in a strange\\r\\nforeign voice. “You are right! I am here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come\\r\\nfrom the walls of her hiding-place. Her face, too, was streaked with\\r\\ngrime, and at the best she could never have been handsome, for she had\\r\\nthe exact physical characteristics which Holmes had divined, with, in\\r\\naddition, a long and obstinate chin. What with her natural blindness,\\r\\nand what with the change from dark to light, she stood as one dazed,\\r\\nblinking about her to see where and who we were. And yet, in spite of\\r\\nall these disadvantages, there was a certain nobility in the woman’s\\r\\nbearing--a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head, which\\r\\ncompelled something of respect and admiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanley Hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his\\r\\nprisoner, but she waved him aside gently, and yet with an over-mastering\\r\\ndignity which compelled obedience. The old man lay back in his chair\\r\\nwith a twitching face, and stared at her with brooding eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I am your prisoner,” she said. “From where I stood I could\\r\\nhear everything, and I know that you have learned the truth. I confess\\r\\nit all. It was I who killed the young man. But you are right--you who\\r\\nsay it was an accident. I did not even know that it was a knife which\\r\\nI held in my hand, for in my despair I snatched anything from the table\\r\\nand struck at him to make him let me go. It is the truth that I tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Madam,” said Holmes, “I am sure that it is the truth. I fear that you\\r\\nare far from well.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had turned a dreadful colour, the more ghastly under the dark\\r\\ndust-streaks upon her face. She seated herself on the side of the bed;\\r\\nthen she resumed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have only a little time here,” she said, “but I would have you to\\r\\nknow the whole truth. I am this man’s wife. He is not an Englishman. He\\r\\nis a Russian. His name I will not tell.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the first time the old man stirred. “God bless you, Anna!” he cried.\\r\\n“God bless you!”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction. “Why should you\\r\\ncling so hard to that wretched life of yours, Sergius?” said she. “It\\r\\nhas done harm to many and good to none--not even to yourself. However,\\r\\nit is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before God’s\\r\\ntime. I have enough already upon my soul since I crossed the threshold\\r\\nof this cursed house. But I must speak or I shall be too late.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have said, gentlemen, that I am this man’s wife. He was fifty and I\\r\\na foolish girl of twenty when we married. It was in a city of Russia, a\\r\\nuniversity--I will not name the place.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“God bless you, Anna!” murmured the old man again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were reformers--revolutionists--Nihilists, you understand. He and I\\r\\nand many more. Then there came a time of trouble, a police officer was\\r\\nkilled, many were arrested, evidence was wanted, and in order to save\\r\\nhis own life and to earn a great reward, my husband betrayed his own\\r\\nwife and his companions. Yes, we were all arrested upon his confession.\\r\\nSome of us found our way to the gallows, and some to Siberia. I was\\r\\namong these last, but my term was not for life. My husband came to\\r\\nEngland with his ill-gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since,\\r\\nknowing well that if the Brotherhood knew where he was not a week would\\r\\npass before justice would be done.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a\\r\\ncigarette. “I am in your hands, Anna,” said he. “You were always good to\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have not yet told you the height of his villainy,” said she. “Among\\r\\nour comrades of the Order, there was one who was the friend of my heart.\\r\\nHe was noble, unselfish, loving--all that my husband was not. He hated\\r\\nviolence. We were all guilty--if that is guilt--but he was not. He wrote\\r\\nforever dissuading us from such a course. These letters would have saved\\r\\nhim. So would my diary, in which, from day to day, I had entered both my\\r\\nfeelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken. My husband\\r\\nfound and kept both diary and letters. He hid them, and he tried hard to\\r\\nswear away the young man’s life. In this he failed, but Alexis was sent\\r\\na convict to Siberia, where now, at this moment, he works in a salt\\r\\nmine. Think of that, you villain, you villain!--now, now, at this very\\r\\nmoment, Alexis, a man whose name you are not worthy to speak, works and\\r\\nlives like a slave, and yet I have your life in my hands, and I let you\\r\\ngo.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were always a noble woman, Anna,” said the old man, puffing at his\\r\\ncigarette.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had risen, but she fell back again with a little cry of pain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must finish,” she said. “When my term was over I set myself to get\\r\\nthe diary and letters which, if sent to the Russian government, would\\r\\nprocure my friend’s release. I knew that my husband had come to England.\\r\\nAfter months of searching I discovered where he was. I knew that he\\r\\nstill had the diary, for when I was in Siberia I had a letter from him\\r\\nonce, reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages. Yet I was\\r\\nsure that, with his revengeful nature, he would never give it to me of\\r\\nhis own free-will. I must get it for myself. With this object I engaged\\r\\nan agent from a private detective firm, who entered my husband’s house\\r\\nas a secretary--it was your second secretary, Sergius, the one who left\\r\\nyou so hurriedly. He found that papers were kept in the cupboard, and he\\r\\ngot an impression of the key. He would not go farther. He furnished me\\r\\nwith a plan of the house, and he told me that in the forenoon the study\\r\\nwas always empty, as the secretary was employed up here. So at last I\\r\\ntook my courage in both hands, and I came down to get the papers for\\r\\nmyself. I succeeded; but at what a cost!\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had just taken the paper; and was locking the cupboard, when the\\r\\nyoung man seized me. I had seen him already that morning. He had met me\\r\\non the road, and I had asked him to tell me where Professor Coram lived,\\r\\nnot knowing that he was in his employ.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly! Exactly!” said Holmes. “The secretary came back, and told his\\r\\nemployer of the woman he had met. Then, in his last breath, he tried to\\r\\nsend a message that it was she--the she whom he had just discussed with\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must let me speak,” said the woman, in an imperative voice, and\\r\\nher face contracted as if in pain. “When he had fallen I rushed from the\\r\\nroom, chose the wrong door, and found myself in my husband’s room. He\\r\\nspoke of giving me up. I showed him that if he did so, his life was in\\r\\nmy hands. If he gave me to the law, I could give him to the Brotherhood.\\r\\nIt was not that I wished to live for my own sake, but it was that\\r\\nI desired to accomplish my purpose. He knew that I would do what I\\r\\nsaid--that his own fate was involved in mine. For that reason, and for\\r\\nno other, he shielded me. He thrust me into that dark hiding-place--a\\r\\nrelic of old days, known only to himself. He took his meals in his own\\r\\nroom, and so was able to give me part of his food. It was agreed that\\r\\nwhen the police left the house I should slip away by night and come back\\r\\nno more. But in some way you have read our plans.” She tore from the\\r\\nbosom of her dress a small packet. “These are my last words,” said she;\\r\\n“here is the packet which will save Alexis. I confide it to your honour\\r\\nand to your love of justice. Take it! You will deliver it at the Russian\\r\\nEmbassy. Now, I have done my duty, and----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stop her!” cried Holmes. He had bounded across the room and had\\r\\nwrenched a small phial from her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Too late!” she said, sinking back on the bed. “Too late! I took the\\r\\npoison before I left my hiding-place. My head swims! I am going! I\\r\\ncharge you, sir, to remember the packet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A simple case, and yet, in some ways, an instructive one,” Holmes\\r\\nremarked, as we travelled back to town. “It hinged from the outset upon\\r\\nthe pince-nez. But for the fortunate chance of the dying man having\\r\\nseized these, I am not sure that we could ever have reached our\\r\\nsolution. It was clear to me, from the strength of the glasses, that\\r\\nthe wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them.\\r\\nWhen you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of\\r\\ngrass without once making a false step, I remarked, as you may remember,\\r\\nthat it was a noteworthy performance. In my mind I set it down as an\\r\\nimpossible performance, save in the unlikely case that she had a second\\r\\npair of glasses. I was forced, therefore, to consider seriously the\\r\\nhypothesis that she had remained within the house. On perceiving the\\r\\nsimilarity of the two corridors, it became clear that she might very\\r\\neasily have made such a mistake, and, in that case, it was evident that\\r\\nshe must have entered the professor’s room. I was keenly on the alert,\\r\\ntherefore, for whatever would bear out this supposition, and I examined\\r\\nthe room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding-place. The\\r\\ncarpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed, so I dismissed the idea of\\r\\na trap-door. There might well be a recess behind the books. As you are\\r\\naware, such devices are common in old libraries. I observed that books\\r\\nwere piled on the floor at all other points, but that one bookcase was\\r\\nleft clear. This, then, might be the door. I could see no marks to guide\\r\\nme, but the carpet was of a dun colour, which lends itself very well\\r\\nto examination. I therefore smoked a great number of those excellent\\r\\ncigarettes, and I dropped the ash all over the space in front of the\\r\\nsuspected bookcase. It was a simple trick, but exceedingly effective.\\r\\nI then went downstairs, and I ascertained, in your presence, Watson,\\r\\nwithout your perceiving the drift of my remarks, that Professor Coram’s\\r\\nconsumption of food had increased--as one would expect when he is\\r\\nsupplying a second person. We then ascended to the room again, when,\\r\\nby upsetting the cigarette-box, I obtained a very excellent view of\\r\\nthe floor, and was able to see quite clearly, from the traces upon the\\r\\ncigarette ash, that the prisoner had in our absence come out from her\\r\\nretreat. Well, Hopkins, here we are at Charing Cross, and I congratulate\\r\\nyou on having brought your case to a successful conclusion. You are\\r\\ngoing to headquarters, no doubt. I think, Watson, you and I will drive\\r\\ntogether to the Russian Embassy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE MISSING THREE-QUARTER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at Baker Street,\\r\\nbut I have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy\\r\\nFebruary morning, some seven or eight years ago, and gave Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes a puzzled quarter of an hour. It was addressed to him, and ran\\r\\nthus:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease await me. Terrible misfortune. Right wing three-quarter missing,\\r\\nindispensable to-morrow. OVERTON.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Strand postmark, and dispatched ten thirty-six,” said Holmes, reading\\r\\nit over and over. “Mr. Overton was evidently considerably excited when\\r\\nhe sent it, and somewhat incoherent in consequence. Well, well, he will\\r\\nbe here, I daresay, by the time I have looked through the TIMES, and\\r\\nthen we shall know all about it. Even the most insignificant problem\\r\\nwould be welcome in these stagnant days.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThings had indeed been very slow with us, and I had learned to dread\\r\\nsuch periods of inaction, for I knew by experience that my companion’s\\r\\nbrain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without\\r\\nmaterial upon which to work. For years I had gradually weaned him\\r\\nfrom that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable\\r\\ncareer. Now I knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer craved\\r\\nfor this artificial stimulus, but I was well aware that the fiend was\\r\\nnot dead but sleeping, and I have known that the sleep was a light one\\r\\nand the waking near when in periods of idleness I have seen the drawn\\r\\nlook upon Holmes’s ascetic face, and the brooding of his deep-set and\\r\\ninscrutable eyes. Therefore I blessed this Mr. Overton whoever he might\\r\\nbe, since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous\\r\\ncalm which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his\\r\\ntempestuous life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we had expected, the telegram was soon followed by its sender, and\\r\\nthe card of Mr. Cyril Overton, Trinity College, Cambridge, announced\\r\\nthe arrival of an enormous young man, sixteen stone of solid bone and\\r\\nmuscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad shoulders, and looked\\r\\nfrom one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with\\r\\nanxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Sherlock Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been down to Scotland Yard, Mr. Holmes. I saw Inspector Stanley\\r\\nHopkins. He advised me to come to you. He said the case, so far as he\\r\\ncould see, was more in your line than in that of the regular police.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray sit down and tell me what is the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s awful, Mr. Holmes--simply awful I wonder my hair isn’t gray.\\r\\nGodfrey Staunton--you’ve heard of him, of course? He’s simply the hinge\\r\\nthat the whole team turns on. I’d rather spare two from the pack,\\r\\nand have Godfrey for my three-quarter line. Whether it’s passing, or\\r\\ntackling, or dribbling, there’s no one to touch him, and then, he’s got\\r\\nthe head, and can hold us all together. What am I to do? That’s what I\\r\\nask you, Mr. Holmes. There’s Moorhouse, first reserve, but he is trained\\r\\nas a half, and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of\\r\\nkeeping out on the touchline. He’s a fine place-kick, it’s true, but\\r\\nthen he has no judgment, and he can’t sprint for nuts. Why, Morton or\\r\\nJohnson, the Oxford fliers, could romp round him. Stevenson is\\r\\nfast enough, but he couldn’t drop from the twenty-five line, and a\\r\\nthree-quarter who can’t either punt or drop isn’t worth a place for\\r\\npace alone. No, Mr. Holmes, we are done unless you can help me to find\\r\\nGodfrey Staunton.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech, which\\r\\nwas poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness, every point\\r\\nbeing driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon the speaker’s\\r\\nknee. When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out his hand and took\\r\\ndown letter “S” of his commonplace book. For once he dug in vain into\\r\\nthat mine of varied information.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is Arthur H. Staunton, the rising young forger,” said he, “and\\r\\nthere was Henry Staunton, whom I helped to hang, but Godfrey Staunton is\\r\\na new name to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was our visitor’s turn to look surprised.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, Mr. Holmes, I thought you knew things,” said he. “I suppose,\\r\\nthen, if you have never heard of Godfrey Staunton, you don’t know Cyril\\r\\nOverton either?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head good humouredly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Great Scott!” cried the athlete. “Why, I was first reserve for England\\r\\nagainst Wales, and I’ve skippered the ‘Varsity all this year. But that’s\\r\\nnothing! I didn’t think there was a soul in England who didn’t know\\r\\nGodfrey Staunton, the crack three-quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and\\r\\nfive Internationals. Good Lord! Mr. Holmes, where HAVE you lived?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed at the young giant’s naive astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton--a sweeter and\\r\\nhealthier one. My ramifications stretch out into many sections of\\r\\nsociety, but never, I am happy to say, into amateur sport, which is the\\r\\nbest and soundest thing in England. However, your unexpected visit this\\r\\nmorning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play,\\r\\nthere may be work for me to do. So now, my good sir, I beg you to sit\\r\\ndown and to tell me, slowly and quietly, exactly what it is that has\\r\\noccurred, and how you desire that I should help you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Overton’s face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more\\r\\naccustomed to using his muscles than his wits, but by degrees, with many\\r\\nrepetitions and obscurities which I may omit from his narrative, he laid\\r\\nhis strange story before us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s this way, Mr. Holmes. As I have said, I am the skipper of the\\r\\nRugger team of Cambridge ‘Varsity, and Godfrey Staunton is my best man.\\r\\nTo-morrow we play Oxford. Yesterday we all came up, and we settled at\\r\\nBentley’s private hotel. At ten o’clock I went round and saw that all\\r\\nthe fellows had gone to roost, for I believe in strict training and\\r\\nplenty of sleep to keep a team fit. I had a word or two with Godfrey\\r\\nbefore he turned in. He seemed to me to be pale and bothered. I asked\\r\\nhim what was the matter. He said he was all right--just a touch of\\r\\nheadache. I bade him good-night and left him. Half an hour later, the\\r\\nporter tells me that a rough-looking man with a beard called with a note\\r\\nfor Godfrey. He had not gone to bed, and the note was taken to his room.\\r\\nGodfrey read it, and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole-axed.\\r\\nThe porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me, but Godfrey\\r\\nstopped him, had a drink of water, and pulled himself together. Then\\r\\nhe went downstairs, said a few words to the man who was waiting in the\\r\\nhall, and the two of them went off together. The last that the porter\\r\\nsaw of them, they were almost running down the street in the direction\\r\\nof the Strand. This morning Godfrey’s room was empty, his bed had never\\r\\nbeen slept in, and his things were all just as I had seen them the night\\r\\nbefore. He had gone off at a moment’s notice with this stranger, and no\\r\\nword has come from him since. I don’t believe he will ever come back. He\\r\\nwas a sportsman, was Godfrey, down to his marrow, and he wouldn’t have\\r\\nstopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some\\r\\ncause that was too strong for him. No: I feel as if he were gone for\\r\\ngood, and we should never see him again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular\\r\\nnarrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you do?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wired to Cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there.\\r\\nI have had an answer. No one has seen him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could he have got back to Cambridge?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, there is a late train--quarter-past eleven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But, so far as you can ascertain, he did not take it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he has not been seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did you do next?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wired to Lord Mount-James.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why to Lord Mount-James?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Godfrey is an orphan, and Lord Mount-James is his nearest relative--his\\r\\nuncle, I believe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed. This throws new light upon the matter. Lord Mount-James is one\\r\\nof the richest men in England.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So I’ve heard Godfrey say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your friend was closely related?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he was his heir, and the old boy is nearly eighty--cram full of\\r\\ngout, too. They say he could chalk his billiard-cue with his knuckles.\\r\\nHe never allowed Godfrey a shilling in his life, for he is an absolute\\r\\nmiser, but it will all come to him right enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you heard from Lord Mount-James?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What motive could your friend have in going to Lord Mount-James?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, something was worrying him the night before, and if it was to do\\r\\nwith money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative,\\r\\nwho had so much of it, though from all I have heard he would not have\\r\\nmuch chance of getting it. Godfrey was not fond of the old man. He would\\r\\nnot go if he could help it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we can soon determine that. If your friend was going to his\\r\\nrelative, Lord Mount-James, you have then to explain the visit of this\\r\\nrough-looking fellow at so late an hour, and the agitation that was\\r\\ncaused by his coming.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCyril Overton pressed his hands to his head. “I can make nothing of it,”\\r\\n said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, well, I have a clear day, and I shall be happy to look into the\\r\\nmatter,” said Holmes. “I should strongly recommend you to make your\\r\\npreparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman.\\r\\nIt must, as you say, have been an overpowering necessity which tore him\\r\\naway in such a fashion, and the same necessity is likely to hold him\\r\\naway. Let us step round together to the hotel, and see if the porter can\\r\\nthrow any fresh light upon the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes was a past-master in the art of putting a humble\\r\\nwitness at his ease, and very soon, in the privacy of Godfrey Staunton’s\\r\\nabandoned room, he had extracted all that the porter had to tell.\\r\\nThe visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither was he a\\r\\nworkingman. He was simply what the porter described as a “medium-looking\\r\\nchap,” a man of fifty, beard grizzled, pale face, quietly dressed.\\r\\nHe seemed himself to be agitated. The porter had observed his hand\\r\\ntrembling when he had held out the note. Godfrey Staunton had crammed\\r\\nthe note into his pocket. Staunton had not shaken hands with the man in\\r\\nthe hall. They had exchanged a few sentences, of which the porter had\\r\\nonly distinguished the one word “time.” Then they had hurried off in the\\r\\nmanner described. It was just half-past ten by the hall clock.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see,” said Holmes, seating himself on Staunton’s bed. “You are\\r\\nthe day porter, are you not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I go off duty at eleven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The night porter saw nothing, I suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, one theatre party came in late. No one else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were you on duty all day yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you take any messages to Mr. Staunton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, one telegram.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah! that’s interesting. What o’clock was this?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“About six.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was Mr. Staunton when he received it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here in his room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Were you present when he opened it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, I waited to see if there was an answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, was there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, he wrote an answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you take it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, he took it himself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he wrote it in your presence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir. I was standing by the door, and he with his back turned at\\r\\nthat table. When he had written it, he said: ‘All right, porter, I will\\r\\ntake this myself.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What did he write it with?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A pen, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the telegraphic form one of these on the table?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, it was the top one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose. Taking the forms, he carried them over to the window and\\r\\ncarefully examined that which was uppermost.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is a pity he did not write in pencil,” said he, throwing them down\\r\\nagain with a shrug of disappointment. “As you have no doubt frequently\\r\\nobserved, Watson, the impression usually goes through--a fact which has\\r\\ndissolved many a happy marriage. However, I can find no trace here. I\\r\\nrejoice, however, to perceive that he wrote with a broad-pointed quill\\r\\npen, and I can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this\\r\\nblotting-pad. Ah, yes, surely this is the very thing!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tore off a strip of the blotting-paper and turned towards us the\\r\\nfollowing hieroglyphic:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCyril Overton was much excited. “Hold it to the glass!” he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is unnecessary,” said Holmes. “The paper is thin, and the reverse\\r\\nwill give the message. Here it is.” He turned it over, and we read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGRAPHIC [Stand by us for Gods sake]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“So that is the tail end of the telegram which Godfrey Staunton\\r\\ndispatched within a few hours of his disappearance. There are at least\\r\\nsix words of the message which have escaped us; but what remains--‘Stand\\r\\nby us for God’s sake!’--proves that this young man saw a formidable\\r\\ndanger which approached him, and from which someone else could protect\\r\\nhim. ‘US,’ mark you! Another person was involved. Who should it be but\\r\\nthe pale-faced, bearded man, who seemed himself in so nervous a state?\\r\\nWhat, then, is the connection between Godfrey Staunton and the bearded\\r\\nman? And what is the third source from which each of them sought for\\r\\nhelp against pressing danger? Our inquiry has already narrowed down to\\r\\nthat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed,” I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly, my dear Watson. Your reflection, though profound, had already\\r\\ncrossed my mind. But I daresay it may have come to your notice that,\\r\\ncounterfoil of another man’s message, there may be some disinclination\\r\\non the part of the officials to oblige you. There is so much red tape in\\r\\nthese matters. However, I have no doubt that with a little delicacy\\r\\nand finesse the end may be attained. Meanwhile, I should like in your\\r\\npresence, Mr. Overton, to go through these papers which have been left\\r\\nupon the table.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a number of letters, bills, and notebooks, which Holmes\\r\\nturned over and examined with quick, nervous fingers and darting,\\r\\npenetrating eyes. “Nothing here,” he said, at last. “By the way, I\\r\\nsuppose your friend was a healthy young fellow--nothing amiss with him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sound as a bell.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you ever known him ill?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a day. He has been laid up with a hack, and once he slipped his\\r\\nknee-cap, but that was nothing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose. I should think he may\\r\\nhave had some secret trouble. With your assent, I will put one or two\\r\\nof these papers in my pocket, in case they should bear upon our future\\r\\ninquiry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One moment--one moment!” cried a querulous voice, and we looked up to\\r\\nfind a queer little old man, jerking and twitching in the doorway. He\\r\\nwas dressed in rusty black, with a very broad-brimmed top-hat and a\\r\\nloose white necktie--the whole effect being that of a very rustic parson\\r\\nor of an undertaker’s mute. Yet, in spite of his shabby and even absurd\\r\\nappearance, his voice had a sharp crackle, and his manner a quick\\r\\nintensity which commanded attention.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, sir, and by what right do you touch this gentleman’s\\r\\npapers?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am a private detective, and I am endeavouring to explain his\\r\\ndisappearance.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you are, are you? And who instructed you, eh?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This gentleman, Mr. Staunton’s friend, was referred to me by Scotland\\r\\nYard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who are you, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Cyril Overton.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then it is you who sent me a telegram. My name is Lord Mount-James. I\\r\\ncame round as quickly as the Bayswater bus would bring me. So you have\\r\\ninstructed a detective?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And are you prepared to meet the cost?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no doubt, sir, that my friend Godfrey, when we find him, will be\\r\\nprepared to do that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But if he is never found, eh? Answer me that!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case, no doubt his family----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort, sir!” screamed the little man. “Don’t look to me\\r\\nfor a penny--not a penny! You understand that, Mr. Detective! I am all\\r\\nthe family that this young man has got, and I tell you that I am not\\r\\nresponsible. If he has any expectations it is due to the fact that I\\r\\nhave never wasted money, and I do not propose to begin to do so now. As\\r\\nto those papers with which you are making so free, I may tell you that\\r\\nin case there should be anything of any value among them, you will be\\r\\nheld strictly to account for what you do with them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, sir,” said Sherlock Holmes. “May I ask, in the meanwhile,\\r\\nwhether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man’s\\r\\ndisappearance?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, I have not. He is big enough and old enough to look after\\r\\nhimself, and if he is so foolish as to lose himself, I entirely refuse\\r\\nto accept the responsibility of hunting for him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I quite understand your position,” said Holmes, with a mischievous\\r\\ntwinkle in his eyes. “Perhaps you don’t quite understand mine. Godfrey\\r\\nStaunton appears to have been a poor man. If he has been kidnapped, it\\r\\ncould not have been for anything which he himself possesses. The fame\\r\\nof your wealth has gone abroad, Lord Mount-James, and it is entirely\\r\\npossible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to\\r\\ngain from him some information as to your house, your habits, and your\\r\\ntreasure.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his\\r\\nneckcloth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Heavens, sir, what an idea! I never thought of such villainy! What\\r\\ninhuman rogues there are in the world! But Godfrey is a fine lad--a\\r\\nstaunch lad. Nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away. I’ll\\r\\nhave the plate moved over to the bank this evening. In the meantime\\r\\nspare no pains, Mr. Detective! I beg you to leave no stone unturned to\\r\\nbring him safely back. As to money, well, so far as a fiver or even a\\r\\ntenner goes you can always look to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in his chastened frame of mind, the noble miser could give us no\\r\\ninformation which could help us, for he knew little of the private life\\r\\nof his nephew. Our only clue lay in the truncated telegram, and with a\\r\\ncopy of this in his hand Holmes set forth to find a second link for\\r\\nhis chain. We had shaken off Lord Mount-James, and Overton had gone to\\r\\nconsult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had\\r\\nbefallen them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a telegraph-office at a short distance from the hotel. We\\r\\nhalted outside it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s worth trying, Watson,” said Holmes. “Of course, with a warrant we\\r\\ncould demand to see the counterfoils, but we have not reached that stage\\r\\nyet. I don’t suppose they remember faces in so busy a place. Let us\\r\\nventure it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry to trouble you,” said he, in his blandest manner, to the\\r\\nyoung woman behind the grating; “there is some small mistake about a\\r\\ntelegram I sent yesterday. I have had no answer, and I very much fear\\r\\nthat I must have omitted to put my name at the end. Could you tell me if\\r\\nthis was so?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What o’clock was it?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A little after six.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whom was it to?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me. “The last words\\r\\nin it were ‘For God’s sake,’” he whispered, confidentially; “I am very\\r\\nanxious at getting no answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young woman separated one of the forms.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is it. There is no name,” said she, smoothing it out upon the\\r\\ncounter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then that, of course, accounts for my getting no answer,” said Holmes.\\r\\n“Dear me, how very stupid of me, to be sure! Good-morning, miss, and\\r\\nmany thanks for having relieved my mind.” He chuckled and rubbed his\\r\\nhands when we found ourselves in the street once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We progress, my dear Watson, we progress. I had seven different schemes\\r\\nfor getting a glimpse of that telegram, but I could hardly hope to\\r\\nsucceed the very first time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what have you gained?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A starting-point for our investigation.” He hailed a cab. “King’s Cross\\r\\nStation,” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have a journey, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I think we must run down to Cambridge together. All the\\r\\nindications seem to me to point in that direction.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tell me,” I asked, as we rattled up Gray’s Inn Road, “have you any\\r\\nsuspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance? I don’t think that\\r\\namong all our cases I have known one where the motives are more obscure.\\r\\nSurely you don’t really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to\\r\\ngive information against his wealthy uncle?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess, my dear Watson, that that does not appeal to me as a very\\r\\nprobable explanation. It struck me, however, as being the one which was\\r\\nmost likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It certainly did that; but what are your alternatives?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could mention several. You must admit that it is curious and\\r\\nsuggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important\\r\\nmatch, and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to\\r\\nthe success of the side. It may, of course, be a coincidence, but it\\r\\nis interesting. Amateur sport is free from betting, but a good deal of\\r\\noutside betting goes on among the public, and it is possible that it\\r\\nmight be worth someone’s while to get at a player as the ruffians of\\r\\nthe turf get at a race-horse. There is one explanation. A second\\r\\nvery obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great\\r\\nproperty, however modest his means may at present be, and it is not\\r\\nimpossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“These theories take no account of the telegram.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite true, Watson. The telegram still remains the only solid thing\\r\\nwith which we have to deal, and we must not permit our attention to\\r\\nwander away from it. It is to gain light upon the purpose of this\\r\\ntelegram that we are now upon our way to Cambridge. The path of our\\r\\ninvestigation is at present obscure, but I shall be very much surprised\\r\\nif before evening we have not cleared it up, or made a considerable\\r\\nadvance along it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was already dark when we reached the old university city. Holmes took\\r\\na cab at the station and ordered the man to drive to the house of Dr.\\r\\nLeslie Armstrong. A few minutes later, we had stopped at a large mansion\\r\\nin the busiest thoroughfare. We were shown in, and after a long wait\\r\\nwere at last admitted into the consulting-room, where we found the\\r\\ndoctor seated behind his table.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt argues the degree in which I had lost touch with my profession that\\r\\nthe name of Leslie Armstrong was unknown to me. Now I am aware that he\\r\\nis not only one of the heads of the medical school of the university,\\r\\nbut a thinker of European reputation in more than one branch of science.\\r\\nYet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be\\r\\nimpressed by a mere glance at the man, the square, massive face, the\\r\\nbrooding eyes under the thatched brows, and the granite moulding of the\\r\\ninflexible jaw. A man of deep character, a man with an alert mind, grim,\\r\\nascetic, self-contained, formidable--so I read Dr. Leslie Armstrong. He\\r\\nheld my friend’s card in his hand, and he looked up with no very pleased\\r\\nexpression upon his dour features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have heard your name, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and I am aware of your\\r\\nprofession--one of which I by no means approve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that, Doctor, you will find yourself in agreement with every\\r\\ncriminal in the country,” said my friend, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime,\\r\\nsir, they must have the support of every reasonable member of the\\r\\ncommunity, though I cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply\\r\\nsufficient for the purpose. Where your calling is more open to criticism\\r\\nis when you pry into the secrets of private individuals, when you rake\\r\\nup family matters which are better hidden, and when you incidentally\\r\\nwaste the time of men who are more busy than yourself. At the present\\r\\nmoment, for example, I should be writing a treatise instead of\\r\\nconversing with you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt, Doctor; and yet the conversation may prove more important\\r\\nthan the treatise. Incidentally, I may tell you that we are doing the\\r\\nreverse of what you very justly blame, and that we are endeavouring\\r\\nto prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must\\r\\nnecessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the\\r\\nofficial police. You may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer,\\r\\nwho goes in front of the regular forces of the country. I have come to\\r\\nask you about Mr. Godfrey Staunton.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What about him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You know him, do you not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is an intimate friend of mine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are aware that he has disappeared?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, indeed!” There was no change of expression in the rugged features\\r\\nof the doctor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He left his hotel last night--he has not been heard of.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt he will return.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow is the ‘Varsity football match.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no sympathy with these childish games. The young man’s fate\\r\\ninterests me deeply, since I know him and like him. The football match\\r\\ndoes not come within my horizon at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I claim your sympathy, then, in my investigation of Mr. Staunton’s\\r\\nfate. Do you know where he is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have not seen him since yesterday?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I have not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was Mr. Staunton a healthy man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Absolutely.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you ever know him ill?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor’s eyes. “Then perhaps\\r\\nyou will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas, paid by Mr.\\r\\nGodfrey Staunton last month to Dr. Leslie Armstrong, of Cambridge. I\\r\\npicked it out from among the papers upon his desk.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe doctor flushed with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not feel that there is any reason why I should render an\\r\\nexplanation to you, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes replaced the bill in his notebook. “If you prefer a public\\r\\nexplanation, it must come sooner or later,” said he. “I have already\\r\\ntold you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to publish,\\r\\nand you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I know nothing about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you hear from Mr. Staunton in London?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, dear me--the postoffice again!” Holmes sighed, wearily.\\r\\n“A most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from London by Godfrey\\r\\nStaunton at six-fifteen yesterday evening--a telegram which is\\r\\nundoubtedly associated with his disappearance--and yet you have not had\\r\\nit. It is most culpable. I shall certainly go down to the office here\\r\\nand register a complaint.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Leslie Armstrong sprang up from behind his desk, and his dark face\\r\\nwas crimson with fury.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll trouble you to walk out of my house, sir,” said he. “You can tell\\r\\nyour employer, Lord Mount-James, that I do not wish to have anything to\\r\\ndo either with him or with his agents. No, sir--not another word!” He\\r\\nrang the bell furiously. “John, show these gentlemen out!” A pompous\\r\\nbutler ushered us severely to the door, and we found ourselves in the\\r\\nstreet. Holmes burst out laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Leslie Armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character,” said\\r\\nhe. “I have not seen a man who, if he turns his talents that way, was\\r\\nmore calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious Moriarty.\\r\\nAnd now, my poor Watson, here we are, stranded and friendless in this\\r\\ninhospitable town, which we cannot leave without abandoning our case.\\r\\nThis little inn just opposite Armstrong’s house is singularly adapted to\\r\\nour needs. If you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries\\r\\nfor the night, I may have time to make a few inquiries.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThese few inquiries proved, however, to be a more lengthy proceeding\\r\\nthan Holmes had imagined, for he did not return to the inn until nearly\\r\\nnine o’clock. He was pale and dejected, stained with dust, and exhausted\\r\\nwith hunger and fatigue. A cold supper was ready upon the table, and\\r\\nwhen his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was ready to take\\r\\nthat half comic and wholly philosophic view which was natural to him\\r\\nwhen his affairs were going awry. The sound of carriage wheels caused\\r\\nhim to rise and glance out of the window. A brougham and pair of grays,\\r\\nunder the glare of a gas-lamp, stood before the doctor’s door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s been out three hours,” said Holmes; “started at half-past six, and\\r\\nhere it is back again. That gives a radius of ten or twelve miles, and\\r\\nhe does it once, or sometimes twice, a day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No unusual thing for a doctor in practice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But Armstrong is not really a doctor in practice. He is a lecturer and\\r\\na consultant, but he does not care for general practice, which distracts\\r\\nhim from his literary work. Why, then, does he make these long journeys,\\r\\nwhich must be exceedingly irksome to him, and who is it that he visits?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His coachman----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Watson, can you doubt that it was to him that I first applied?\\r\\nI do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the\\r\\npromptings of his master, but he was rude enough to set a dog at me.\\r\\nNeither dog nor man liked the look of my stick, however, and the matter\\r\\nfell through. Relations were strained after that, and further inquiries\\r\\nout of the question. All that I have learned I got from a friendly\\r\\nnative in the yard of our own inn. It was he who told me of the doctor’s\\r\\nhabits and of his daily journey. At that instant, to give point to his\\r\\nwords, the carriage came round to the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could you not follow it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent, Watson! You are scintillating this evening. The idea did\\r\\ncross my mind. There is, as you may have observed, a bicycle shop next\\r\\nto our inn. Into this I rushed, engaged a bicycle, and was able to get\\r\\nstarted before the carriage was quite out of sight. I rapidly overtook\\r\\nit, and then, keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so, I\\r\\nfollowed its lights until we were clear of the town. We had got well out\\r\\non the country road, when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred. The\\r\\ncarriage stopped, the doctor alighted, walked swiftly back to where I\\r\\nhad also halted, and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that\\r\\nhe feared the road was narrow, and that he hoped his carriage did not\\r\\nimpede the passage of my bicycle. Nothing could have been more admirable\\r\\nthan his way of putting it. I at once rode past the carriage, and,\\r\\nkeeping to the main road, I went on for a few miles, and then halted in\\r\\na convenient place to see if the carriage passed. There was no sign of\\r\\nit, however, and so it became evident that it had turned down one of\\r\\nseveral side roads which I had observed. I rode back, but again saw\\r\\nnothing of the carriage, and now, as you perceive, it has returned after\\r\\nme. Of course, I had at the outset no particular reason to connect\\r\\nthese journeys with the disappearance of Godfrey Staunton, and was only\\r\\ninclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything\\r\\nwhich concerns Dr. Armstrong is at present of interest to us, but, now\\r\\nthat I find he keeps so keen a look-out upon anyone who may follow him\\r\\non these excursions, the affair appears more important, and I shall not\\r\\nbe satisfied until I have made the matter clear.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can follow him to-morrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can we? It is not so easy as you seem to think. You are not familiar\\r\\nwith Cambridgeshire scenery, are you? It does not lend itself to\\r\\nconcealment. All this country that I passed over to-night is as flat and\\r\\nclean as the palm of your hand, and the man we are following is no fool,\\r\\nas he very clearly showed to-night. I have wired to Overton to let us\\r\\nknow any fresh London developments at this address, and in the meantime\\r\\nwe can only concentrate our attention upon Dr. Armstrong, whose name\\r\\nthe obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the\\r\\ncounterfoil of Staunton’s urgent message. He knows where the young man\\r\\nis--to that I’ll swear, and if he knows, then it must be our own fault\\r\\nif we cannot manage to know also. At present it must be admitted that\\r\\nthe odd trick is in his possession, and, as you are aware, Watson, it is\\r\\nnot my habit to leave the game in that condition.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the\\r\\nmystery. A note was handed in after breakfast, which Holmes passed\\r\\nacross to me with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSIR [it ran]:\\r\\n\\r\\nI can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my movements.\\r\\nI have, as you discovered last night, a window at the back of my\\r\\nbrougham, and if you desire a twenty-mile ride which will lead you to\\r\\nthe spot from which you started, you have only to follow me. Meanwhile,\\r\\nI can inform you that no spying upon me can in any way help Mr. Godfrey\\r\\nStaunton, and I am convinced that the best service you can do to that\\r\\ngentleman is to return at once to London and to report to your employer\\r\\nthat you are unable to trace him. Your time in Cambridge will certainly\\r\\nbe wasted. Yours faithfully, LESLIE ARMSTRONG.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“An outspoken, honest antagonist is the doctor,” said Holmes. “Well,\\r\\nwell, he excites my curiosity, and I must really know before I leave\\r\\nhim.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His carriage is at his door now,” said I. “There he is stepping into\\r\\nit. I saw him glance up at our window as he did so. Suppose I try my\\r\\nluck upon the bicycle?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my dear Watson! With all respect for your natural acumen, I do\\r\\nnot think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor. I think that\\r\\npossibly I can attain our end by some independent explorations of my\\r\\nown. I am afraid that I must leave you to your own devices, as the\\r\\nappearance of TWO inquiring strangers upon a sleepy countryside might\\r\\nexcite more gossip than I care for. No doubt you will find some sights\\r\\nto amuse you in this venerable city, and I hope to bring back a more\\r\\nfavourable report to you before evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more, however, my friend was destined to be disappointed. He came\\r\\nback at night weary and unsuccessful.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had a blank day, Watson. Having got the doctor’s general\\r\\ndirection, I spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side\\r\\nof Cambridge, and comparing notes with publicans and other local news\\r\\nagencies. I have covered some ground. Chesterton, Histon, Waterbeach,\\r\\nand Oakington have each been explored, and have each proved\\r\\ndisappointing. The daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly\\r\\nhave been overlooked in such Sleepy Hollows. The doctor has scored once\\r\\nmore. Is there a telegram for me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I opened it. Here it is:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ask for Pompey from Jeremy Dixon, Trinity College.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t understand it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, it is clear enough. It is from our friend Overton, and is in answer\\r\\nto a question from me. I’ll just send round a note to Mr. Jeremy Dixon,\\r\\nand then I have no doubt that our luck will turn. By the way, is there\\r\\nany news of the match?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last\\r\\nedition. Oxford won by a goal and two tries. The last sentences of the\\r\\ndescription say:\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘The defeat of the Light Blues may be entirely attributed to the\\r\\nunfortunate absence of the crack International, Godfrey Staunton, whose\\r\\nwant was felt at every instant of the game. The lack of combination in\\r\\nthe three-quarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence\\r\\nmore than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard-working pack.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then our friend Overton’s forebodings have been justified,” said\\r\\nHolmes. “Personally I am in agreement with Dr. Armstrong, and football\\r\\ndoes not come within my horizon. Early to bed to-night, Watson, for I\\r\\nforesee that to-morrow may be an eventful day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was horrified by my first glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he\\r\\nsat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe. I associated that\\r\\ninstrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared the\\r\\nworst when I saw it glittering in his hand. He laughed at my expression\\r\\nof dismay and laid it upon the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, my dear fellow, there is no cause for alarm. It is not upon\\r\\nthis occasion the instrument of evil, but it will rather prove to be the\\r\\nkey which will unlock our mystery. On this syringe I base all my hopes.\\r\\nI have just returned from a small scouting expedition, and everything is\\r\\nfavourable. Eat a good breakfast, Watson, for I propose to get upon Dr.\\r\\nArmstrong’s trail to-day, and once on it I will not stop for rest or\\r\\nfood until I run him to his burrow.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case,” said I, “we had best carry our breakfast with us, for he\\r\\nis making an early start. His carriage is at the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind. Let him go. He will be clever if he can drive where I\\r\\ncannot follow him. When you have finished, come downstairs with me, and\\r\\nI will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in\\r\\nthe work that lies before us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we descended I followed Holmes into the stable yard, where\\r\\nhe opened the door of a loose-box and led out a squat, lop-eared,\\r\\nwhite-and-tan dog, something between a beagle and a foxhound.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me introduce you to Pompey,” said he. “Pompey is the pride of the\\r\\nlocal draghounds--no very great flier, as his build will show, but\\r\\na staunch hound on a scent. Well, Pompey, you may not be fast, but\\r\\nI expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle-aged London\\r\\ngentlemen, so I will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to\\r\\nyour collar. Now, boy, come along, and show what you can do.” He led him\\r\\nacross to the doctor’s door. The dog sniffed round for an instant, and\\r\\nthen with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street,\\r\\ntugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster. In half an hour, we\\r\\nwere clear of the town and hastening down a country road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What have you done, Holmes?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A threadbare and venerable device, but useful upon occasion. I walked\\r\\ninto the doctor’s yard this morning, and shot my syringe full of aniseed\\r\\nover the hind wheel. A draghound will follow aniseed from here to John\\r\\no’Groat’s, and our friend, Armstrong, would have to drive through the\\r\\nCam before he would shake Pompey off his trail. Oh, the cunning rascal!\\r\\nThis is how he gave me the slip the other night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a grass-grown\\r\\nlane. Half a mile farther this opened into another broad road, and the\\r\\ntrail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town, which we\\r\\nhad just quitted. The road took a sweep to the south of the town, and\\r\\ncontinued in the opposite direction to that in which we started.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This DETOUR has been entirely for our benefit, then?” said Holmes.\\r\\n“No wonder that my inquiries among those villagers led to nothing. The\\r\\ndoctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth, and one would\\r\\nlike to know the reason for such elaborate deception. This should be\\r\\nthe village of Trumpington to the right of us. And, by Jove! here is the\\r\\nbrougham coming round the corner. Quick, Watson--quick, or we are done!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe sprang through a gate into a field, dragging the reluctant Pompey\\r\\nafter him. We had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the\\r\\ncarriage rattled past. I caught a glimpse of Dr. Armstrong within, his\\r\\nshoulders bowed, his head sunk on his hands, the very image of distress.\\r\\nI could tell by my companion’s graver face that he also had seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear there is some dark ending to our quest,” said he. “It cannot\\r\\nbe long before we know it. Come, Pompey! Ah, it is the cottage in the\\r\\nfield!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey.\\r\\nPompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate, where the marks\\r\\nof the brougham’s wheels were still to be seen. A footpath led across\\r\\nto the lonely cottage. Holmes tied the dog to the hedge, and we hastened\\r\\nonward. My friend knocked at the little rustic door, and knocked again\\r\\nwithout response. And yet the cottage was not deserted, for a low\\r\\nsound came to our ears--a kind of drone of misery and despair which was\\r\\nindescribably melancholy. Holmes paused irresolute, and then he glanced\\r\\nback at the road which he had just traversed. A brougham was coming down\\r\\nit, and there could be no mistaking those gray horses.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By Jove, the doctor is coming back!” cried Holmes. “That settles it. We\\r\\nare bound to see what it means before he comes.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe opened the door, and we stepped into the hall. The droning sound\\r\\nswelled louder upon our ears until it became one long, deep wail of\\r\\ndistress. It came from upstairs. Holmes darted up, and I followed him.\\r\\nHe pushed open a half-closed door, and we both stood appalled at the\\r\\nsight before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nA woman, young and beautiful, was lying dead upon the bed. Her calm pale\\r\\nface, with dim, wide-opened blue eyes, looked upward from amid a great\\r\\ntangle of golden hair. At the foot of the bed, half sitting, half\\r\\nkneeling, his face buried in the clothes, was a young man, whose frame\\r\\nwas racked by his sobs. So absorbed was he by his bitter grief, that he\\r\\nnever looked up until Holmes’s hand was on his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you Mr. Godfrey Staunton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, yes, I am--but you are too late. She is dead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we\\r\\nwere anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance. Holmes\\r\\nwas endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation and to explain the\\r\\nalarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance\\r\\nwhen there was a step upon the stairs, and there was the heavy, stern,\\r\\nquestioning face of Dr. Armstrong at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So, gentlemen,” said he, “you have attained your end and have certainly\\r\\nchosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion. I would not\\r\\nbrawl in the presence of death, but I can assure you that if I were a\\r\\nyounger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, Dr. Armstrong, I think we are a little at cross-purposes,”\\r\\n said my friend, with dignity. “If you could step downstairs with us,\\r\\nwe may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable\\r\\naffair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA minute later, the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sitting-room\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir?” said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wish you to understand, in the first place, that I am not employed\\r\\nby Lord Mount-James, and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely\\r\\nagainst that nobleman. When a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his\\r\\nfate, but having done so the matter ends so far as I am concerned, and\\r\\nso long as there is nothing criminal I am much more anxious to hush up\\r\\nprivate scandals than to give them publicity. If, as I imagine, there is\\r\\nno breach of the law in this matter, you can absolutely depend upon my\\r\\ndiscretion and my cooperation in keeping the facts out of the papers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung Holmes by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are a good fellow,” said he. “I had misjudged you. I thank heaven\\r\\nthat my compunction at leaving poor Staunton all alone in this plight\\r\\ncaused me to turn my carriage back and so to make your acquaintance.\\r\\nKnowing as much as you do, the situation is very easily explained.\\r\\nA year ago Godfrey Staunton lodged in London for a time and became\\r\\npassionately attached to his landlady’s daughter, whom he married. She\\r\\nwas as good as she was beautiful and as intelligent as she was good.\\r\\nNo man need be ashamed of such a wife. But Godfrey was the heir to this\\r\\ncrabbed old nobleman, and it was quite certain that the news of his\\r\\nmarriage would have been the end of his inheritance. I knew the lad\\r\\nwell, and I loved him for his many excellent qualities. I did all I\\r\\ncould to help him to keep things straight. We did our very best to keep\\r\\nthe thing from everyone, for, when once such a whisper gets about, it is\\r\\nnot long before everyone has heard it. Thanks to this lonely cottage and\\r\\nhis own discretion, Godfrey has up to now succeeded. Their secret was\\r\\nknown to no one save to me and to one excellent servant, who has at\\r\\npresent gone for assistance to Trumpington. But at last there came a\\r\\nterrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife. It was\\r\\nconsumption of the most virulent kind. The poor boy was half crazed with\\r\\ngrief, and yet he had to go to London to play this match, for he could\\r\\nnot get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret. I\\r\\ntried to cheer him up by wire, and he sent me one in reply, imploring\\r\\nme to do all I could. This was the telegram which you appear in some\\r\\ninexplicable way to have seen. I did not tell him how urgent the danger\\r\\nwas, for I knew that he could do no good here, but I sent the truth to\\r\\nthe girl’s father, and he very injudiciously communicated it to Godfrey.\\r\\nThe result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on\\r\\nfrenzy, and has remained in the same state, kneeling at the end of her\\r\\nbed, until this morning death put an end to her sufferings. That is all,\\r\\nMr. Holmes, and I am sure that I can rely upon your discretion and that\\r\\nof your friend.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes grasped the doctor’s hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Watson,” said he, and we passed from that house of grief into the\\r\\npale sunlight of the winter day.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE ABBEY GRANGE\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning, towards the end of the\\r\\nwinter of ‘97, that I was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder. It was\\r\\nHolmes. The candle in his hand shone upon his eager, stooping face, and\\r\\ntold me at a glance that something was amiss.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Watson, come!” he cried. “The game is afoot. Not a word! Into\\r\\nyour clothes and come!”\\r\\n\\r\\nTen minutes later we were both in a cab, and rattling through the silent\\r\\nstreets on our way to Charing Cross Station. The first faint winter’s\\r\\ndawn was beginning to appear, and we could dimly see the occasional\\r\\nfigure of an early workman as he passed us, blurred and indistinct in\\r\\nthe opalescent London reek. Holmes nestled in silence into his heavy\\r\\ncoat, and I was glad to do the same, for the air was most bitter, and\\r\\nneither of us had broken our fast.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and taken\\r\\nour places in the Kentish train that we were sufficiently thawed, he\\r\\nto speak and I to listen. Holmes drew a note from his pocket, and read\\r\\naloud:\\r\\n\\r\\nAbbey Grange, Marsham, Kent, 3:30 A.M. MY DEAR MR. HOLMES:\\r\\n\\r\\nI should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to\\r\\nbe a most remarkable case. It is something quite in your line. Except\\r\\nfor releasing the lady I will see that everything is kept exactly as I\\r\\nhave found it, but I beg you not to lose an instant, as it is difficult\\r\\nto leave Sir Eustace there. Yours faithfully, STANLEY HOPKINS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hopkins has called me in seven times, and on each occasion his summons\\r\\nhas been entirely justified,” said Holmes. “I fancy that every one of\\r\\nhis cases has found its way into your collection, and I must admit,\\r\\nWatson, that you have some power of selection, which atones for much\\r\\nwhich I deplore in your narratives. Your fatal habit of looking at\\r\\neverything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific\\r\\nexercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even\\r\\nclassical series of demonstrations. You slur over work of the utmost\\r\\nfinesse and delicacy, in order to dwell upon sensational details which\\r\\nmay excite, but cannot possibly instruct, the reader.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why do you not write them yourself?” I said, with some bitterness.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will, my dear Watson, I will. At present I am, as you know, fairly\\r\\nbusy, but I propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a\\r\\ntextbook, which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume.\\r\\nOur present research appears to be a case of murder.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think this Sir Eustace is dead, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should say so. Hopkins’s writing shows considerable agitation, and he\\r\\nis not an emotional man. Yes, I gather there has been violence, and\\r\\nthat the body is left for our inspection. A mere suicide would not\\r\\nhave caused him to send for me. As to the release of the lady, it would\\r\\nappear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy. We\\r\\nare moving in high life, Watson, crackling paper, ‘E.B.’ monogram,\\r\\ncoat-of-arms, picturesque address. I think that friend Hopkins will live\\r\\nup to his reputation, and that we shall have an interesting morning. The\\r\\ncrime was committed before twelve last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can you possibly tell?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By an inspection of the trains, and by reckoning the time. The local\\r\\npolice had to be called in, they had to communicate with Scotland Yard,\\r\\nHopkins had to go out, and he in turn had to send for me. All that makes\\r\\na fair night’s work. Well, here we are at Chiselhurst Station, and we\\r\\nshall soon set our doubts at rest.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us\\r\\nto a park gate, which was opened for us by an old lodge-keeper, whose\\r\\nhaggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster. The avenue ran\\r\\nthrough a noble park, between lines of ancient elms, and ended in a low,\\r\\nwidespread house, pillared in front after the fashion of Palladio. The\\r\\ncentral part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy, but the\\r\\nlarge windows showed that modern changes had been carried out, and one\\r\\nwing of the house appeared to be entirely new. The youthful figure and\\r\\nalert, eager face of Inspector Stanley Hopkins confronted us in the open\\r\\ndoorway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m very glad you have come, Mr. Holmes. And you, too, Dr. Watson. But,\\r\\nindeed, if I had my time over again, I should not have troubled you, for\\r\\nsince the lady has come to herself, she has given so clear an account of\\r\\nthe affair that there is not much left for us to do. You remember that\\r\\nLewisham gang of burglars?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, the three Randalls?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly; the father and two sons. It’s their work. I have not a doubt\\r\\nof it. They did a job at Sydenham a fortnight ago and were seen and\\r\\ndescribed. Rather cool to do another so soon and so near, but it is\\r\\nthey, beyond all doubt. It’s a hanging matter this time.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sir Eustace is dead, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, his head was knocked in with his own poker.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sir Eustace Brackenstall, the driver tells me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly--one of the richest men in Kent--Lady Brackenstall is in the\\r\\nmorning-room. Poor lady, she has had a most dreadful experience. She\\r\\nseemed half dead when I saw her first. I think you had best see her\\r\\nand hear her account of the facts. Then we will examine the dining-room\\r\\ntogether.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Brackenstall was no ordinary person. Seldom have I seen so graceful\\r\\na figure, so womanly a presence, and so beautiful a face. She was\\r\\na blonde, golden-haired, blue-eyed, and would no doubt have had the\\r\\nperfect complexion which goes with such colouring, had not her recent\\r\\nexperience left her drawn and haggard. Her sufferings were physical as\\r\\nwell as mental, for over one eye rose a hideous, plum-coloured swelling,\\r\\nwhich her maid, a tall, austere woman, was bathing assiduously with\\r\\nvinegar and water. The lady lay back exhausted upon a couch, but her\\r\\nquick, observant gaze, as we entered the room, and the alert expression\\r\\nof her beautiful features, showed that neither her wits nor her courage\\r\\nhad been shaken by her terrible experience. She was enveloped in a\\r\\nloose dressing-gown of blue and silver, but a black sequin-covered\\r\\ndinner-dress lay upon the couch beside her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have told you all that happened, Mr. Hopkins,” she said, wearily.\\r\\n“Could you not repeat it for me? Well, if you think it necessary, I will\\r\\ntell these gentlemen what occurred. Have they been in the dining-room\\r\\nyet?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought they had better hear your ladyship’s story first.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be glad when you can arrange matters. It is horrible to me to\\r\\nthink of him still lying there.” She shuddered and buried her face in\\r\\nher hands. As she did so, the loose gown fell back from her forearms.\\r\\nHolmes uttered an exclamation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have other injuries, madam! What is this?” Two vivid red spots\\r\\nstood out on one of the white, round limbs. She hastily covered it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is nothing. It has no connection with this hideous business\\r\\nto-night. If you and your friend will sit down, I will tell you all I\\r\\ncan.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am the wife of Sir Eustace Brackenstall. I have been married about\\r\\na year. I suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our\\r\\nmarriage has not been a happy one. I fear that all our neighbours would\\r\\ntell you that, even if I were to attempt to deny it. Perhaps the fault\\r\\nmay be partly mine. I was brought up in the freer, less conventional\\r\\natmosphere of South Australia, and this English life, with its\\r\\nproprieties and its primness, is not congenial to me. But the main\\r\\nreason lies in the one fact, which is notorious to everyone, and that is\\r\\nthat Sir Eustace was a confirmed drunkard. To be with such a man for an\\r\\nhour is unpleasant. Can you imagine what it means for a sensitive\\r\\nand high-spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night? It is a\\r\\nsacrilege, a crime, a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding.\\r\\nI say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the\\r\\nland--God will not let such wickedness endure.” For an instant she sat\\r\\nup, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes blazing from under the terrible\\r\\nmark upon her brow. Then the strong, soothing hand of the austere maid\\r\\ndrew her head down on to the cushion, and the wild anger died away into\\r\\npassionate sobbing. At last she continued:\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you about last night. You are aware, perhaps, that in this\\r\\nhouse all the servants sleep in the modern wing. This central block is\\r\\nmade up of the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and our bedroom\\r\\nabove. My maid, Theresa, sleeps above my room. There is no one else, and\\r\\nno sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. This must have\\r\\nbeen well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they\\r\\ndid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sir Eustace retired about half-past ten. The servants had already gone\\r\\nto their quarters. Only my maid was up, and she had remained in her room\\r\\nat the top of the house until I needed her services. I sat until after\\r\\neleven in this room, absorbed in a book. Then I walked round to see\\r\\nthat all was right before I went upstairs. It was my custom to do this\\r\\nmyself, for, as I have explained, Sir Eustace was not always to be\\r\\ntrusted. I went into the kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the gun-room,\\r\\nthe billiard-room, the drawing-room, and finally the dining-room. As I\\r\\napproached the window, which is covered with thick curtains, I suddenly\\r\\nfelt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open. I flung\\r\\nthe curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad-shouldered\\r\\nelderly man, who had just stepped into the room. The window is a long\\r\\nFrench one, which really forms a door leading to the lawn. I held my\\r\\nbedroom candle lit in my hand, and, by its light, behind the first man I\\r\\nsaw two others, who were in the act of entering. I stepped back, but the\\r\\nfellow was on me in an instant. He caught me first by the wrist and then\\r\\nby the throat. I opened my mouth to scream, but he struck me a savage\\r\\nblow with his fist over the eye, and felled me to the ground. I must\\r\\nhave been unconscious for a few minutes, for when I came to myself, I\\r\\nfound that they had torn down the bell-rope, and had secured me tightly\\r\\nto the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining-table. I was\\r\\nso firmly bound that I could not move, and a handkerchief round my\\r\\nmouth prevented me from uttering a sound. It was at this instant that\\r\\nmy unfortunate husband entered the room. He had evidently heard some\\r\\nsuspicious sounds, and he came prepared for such a scene as he found.\\r\\nHe was dressed in nightshirt and trousers, with his favourite blackthorn\\r\\ncudgel in his hand. He rushed at the burglars, but another--it was an\\r\\nelderly man--stooped, picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a\\r\\nhorrible blow as he passed. He fell with a groan and never moved again.\\r\\nI fainted once more, but again it could only have been for a very few\\r\\nminutes during which I was insensible. When I opened my eyes I found\\r\\nthat they had collected the silver from the sideboard, and they had\\r\\ndrawn a bottle of wine which stood there. Each of them had a glass in\\r\\nhis hand. I have already told you, have I not, that one was elderly,\\r\\nwith a beard, and the others young, hairless lads. They might have been\\r\\na father with his two sons. They talked together in whispers. Then\\r\\nthey came over and made sure that I was securely bound. Finally they\\r\\nwithdrew, closing the window after them. It was quite a quarter of an\\r\\nhour before I got my mouth free. When I did so, my screams brought the\\r\\nmaid to my assistance. The other servants were soon alarmed, and we sent\\r\\nfor the local police, who instantly communicated with London. That is\\r\\nreally all that I can tell you, gentlemen, and I trust that it will not\\r\\nbe necessary for me to go over so painful a story again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Any questions, Mr. Holmes?” asked Hopkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not impose any further tax upon Lady Brackenstall’s patience and\\r\\ntime,” said Holmes. “Before I go into the dining-room, I should like to\\r\\nhear your experience.” He looked at the maid.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I saw the men before ever they came into the house,” said she. “As I\\r\\nsat by my bedroom window I saw three men in the moonlight down by the\\r\\nlodge gate yonder, but I thought nothing of it at the time. It was more\\r\\nthan an hour after that I heard my mistress scream, and down I ran, to\\r\\nfind her, poor lamb, just as she says, and him on the floor, with his\\r\\nblood and brains over the room. It was enough to drive a woman out of\\r\\nher wits, tied there, and her very dress spotted with him, but she never\\r\\nwanted courage, did Miss Mary Fraser of Adelaide and Lady Brackenstall\\r\\nof Abbey Grange hasn’t learned new ways. You’ve questioned her long\\r\\nenough, you gentlemen, and now she is coming to her own room, just with\\r\\nher old Theresa, to get the rest that she badly needs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her\\r\\nmistress and led her from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“She has been with her all her life,” said Hopkins. “Nursed her as\\r\\na baby, and came with her to England when they first left Australia,\\r\\neighteen months ago. Theresa Wright is her name, and the kind of maid\\r\\nyou don’t pick up nowadays. This way, Mr. Holmes, if you please!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe keen interest had passed out of Holmes’s expressive face, and I\\r\\nknew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed. There\\r\\nstill remained an arrest to be effected, but what were these commonplace\\r\\nrogues that he should soil his hands with them? An abstruse and learned\\r\\nspecialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles\\r\\nwould experience something of the annoyance which I read in my\\r\\nfriend’s eyes. Yet the scene in the dining-room of the Abbey Grange was\\r\\nsufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning\\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a very large and high chamber, with carved oak ceiling, oaken\\r\\npanelling, and a fine array of deer’s heads and ancient weapons around\\r\\nthe walls. At the further end from the door was the high French window\\r\\nof which we had heard. Three smaller windows on the right-hand side\\r\\nfilled the apartment with cold winter sunshine. On the left was a large,\\r\\ndeep fireplace, with a massive, overhanging oak mantelpiece. Beside\\r\\nthe fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and cross-bars at the\\r\\nbottom. In and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord,\\r\\nwhich was secured at each side to the crosspiece below. In releasing the\\r\\nlady, the cord had been slipped off her, but the knots with which it\\r\\nhad been secured still remained. These details only struck our attention\\r\\nafterwards, for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible\\r\\nobject which lay upon the tigerskin hearthrug in front of the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the body of a tall, well-made man, about forty years of age.\\r\\nHe lay upon his back, his face upturned, with his white teeth grinning\\r\\nthrough his short, black beard. His two clenched hands were raised\\r\\nabove his head, and a heavy, blackthorn stick lay across them. His dark,\\r\\nhandsome, aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive\\r\\nhatred, which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression.\\r\\nHe had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out, for he\\r\\nwore a foppish, embroidered nightshirt, and his bare feet projected from\\r\\nhis trousers. His head was horribly injured, and the whole room bore\\r\\nwitness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down.\\r\\nBeside him lay the heavy poker, bent into a curve by the concussion.\\r\\nHolmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had\\r\\nwrought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must be a powerful man, this elder Randall,” he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Hopkins. “I have some record of the fellow, and he is a\\r\\nrough customer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You should have no difficulty in getting him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not the slightest. We have been on the look-out for him, and there was\\r\\nsome idea that he had got away to America. Now that we know that the\\r\\ngang are here, I don’t see how they can escape. We have the news at\\r\\nevery seaport already, and a reward will be offered before evening. What\\r\\nbeats me is how they could have done so mad a thing, knowing that the\\r\\nlady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognize the\\r\\ndescription.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. One would have expected that they would silence Lady\\r\\nBrackenstall as well.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They may not have realized,” I suggested, “that she had recovered from\\r\\nher faint.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is likely enough. If she seemed to be senseless, they would not\\r\\ntake her life. What about this poor fellow, Hopkins? I seem to have\\r\\nheard some queer stories about him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was a good-hearted man when he was sober, but a perfect fiend when\\r\\nhe was drunk, or rather when he was half drunk, for he seldom really\\r\\nwent the whole way. The devil seemed to be in him at such times, and he\\r\\nwas capable of anything. From what I hear, in spite of all his wealth\\r\\nand his title, he very nearly came our way once or twice. There was\\r\\na scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on\\r\\nfire--her ladyship’s dog, to make the matter worse--and that was only\\r\\nhushed up with difficulty. Then he threw a decanter at that maid,\\r\\nTheresa Wright--there was trouble about that. On the whole, and between\\r\\nourselves, it will be a brighter house without him. What are you looking\\r\\nat now?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was down on his knees, examining with great attention the\\r\\nknots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured. Then he\\r\\ncarefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off\\r\\nwhen the burglar had dragged it down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When this was pulled down, the bell in the kitchen must have rung\\r\\nloudly,” he remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one could hear it. The kitchen stands right at the back of the\\r\\nhouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did the burglar know no one would hear it? How dared he pull at a\\r\\nbell-rope in that reckless fashion?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly, Mr. Holmes, exactly. You put the very question which I have\\r\\nasked myself again and again. There can be no doubt that this fellow\\r\\nmust have known the house and its habits. He must have perfectly\\r\\nunderstood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively\\r\\nearly hour, and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the\\r\\nkitchen. Therefore, he must have been in close league with one of the\\r\\nservants. Surely that is evident. But there are eight servants, and all\\r\\nof good character.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Other things being equal,” said Holmes, “one would suspect the one\\r\\nat whose head the master threw a decanter. And yet that would involve\\r\\ntreachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted. Well,\\r\\nwell, the point is a minor one, and when you have Randall you will\\r\\nprobably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice. The lady’s story\\r\\ncertainly seems to be corroborated, if it needed corroboration, by every\\r\\ndetail which we see before us.” He walked to the French window and threw\\r\\nit open. “There are no signs here, but the ground is iron hard, and one\\r\\nwould not expect them. I see that these candles in the mantelpiece have\\r\\nbeen lighted.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it was by their light and that of the lady’s bedroom candle, that\\r\\nthe burglars saw their way about.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what did they take?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, they did not take much--only half a dozen articles of plate off\\r\\nthe sideboard. Lady Brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so\\r\\ndisturbed by the death of Sir Eustace that they did not ransack the\\r\\nhouse, as they would otherwise have done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No doubt that is true, and yet they drank some wine, I understand.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To steady their nerves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. These three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched, I\\r\\nsuppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and the bottle stands as they left it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us look at it. Halloa, halloa! What is this?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three glasses were grouped together, all of them tinged with wine,\\r\\nand one of them containing some dregs of beeswing. The bottle stood near\\r\\nthem, two-thirds full, and beside it lay a long, deeply stained cork.\\r\\nIts appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common\\r\\nvintage which the murderers had enjoyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nA change had come over Holmes’s manner. He had lost his listless\\r\\nexpression, and again I saw an alert light of interest in his keen,\\r\\ndeep-set eyes. He raised the cork and examined it minutely.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did they draw it?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\nHopkins pointed to a half-opened drawer. In it lay some table linen and\\r\\na large corkscrew.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did Lady Brackenstall say that screw was used?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle\\r\\nwas opened.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. As a matter of fact, that screw was not used. This bottle was\\r\\nopened by a pocket screw, probably contained in a knife, and not more\\r\\nthan an inch and a half long. If you will examine the top of the cork,\\r\\nyou will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the\\r\\ncork was extracted. It has never been transfixed. This long screw would\\r\\nhave transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull. When you catch\\r\\nthis fellow, you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in\\r\\nhis possession.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” said Hopkins.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But these glasses do puzzle me, I confess. Lady Brackenstall actually\\r\\nSAW the three men drinking, did she not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; she was clear about that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then there is an end of it. What more is to be said? And yet, you must\\r\\nadmit, that the three glasses are very remarkable, Hopkins. What? You\\r\\nsee nothing remarkable? Well, well, let it pass. Perhaps, when a man has\\r\\nspecial knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages\\r\\nhim to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand. Of\\r\\ncourse, it must be a mere chance about the glasses. Well, good-morning,\\r\\nHopkins. I don’t see that I can be of any use to you, and you appear\\r\\nto have your case very clear. You will let me know when Randall is\\r\\narrested, and any further developments which may occur. I trust that I\\r\\nshall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion. Come,\\r\\nWatson, I fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring our return journey, I could see by Holmes’s face that he was much\\r\\npuzzled by something which he had observed. Every now and then, by an\\r\\neffort, he would throw off the impression, and talk as if the matter\\r\\nwere clear, but then his doubts would settle down upon him again, and\\r\\nhis knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had\\r\\ngone back once more to the great dining-room of the Abbey Grange, in\\r\\nwhich this midnight tragedy had been enacted. At last, by a sudden\\r\\nimpulse, just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station, he\\r\\nsprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me, my dear fellow,” said he, as we watched the rear carriages\\r\\nof our train disappearing round a curve, “I am sorry to make you the\\r\\nvictim of what may seem a mere whim, but on my life, Watson, I simply\\r\\nCAN’T leave that case in this condition. Every instinct that I possess\\r\\ncries out against it. It’s wrong--it’s all wrong--I’ll swear that it’s\\r\\nwrong. And yet the lady’s story was complete, the maid’s corroboration\\r\\nwas sufficient, the detail was fairly exact. What have I to put up\\r\\nagainst that? Three wine-glasses, that is all. But if I had not taken\\r\\nthings for granted, if I had examined everything with the care which\\r\\nI should have shown had we approached the case DE NOVO and had no\\r\\ncut-and-dried story to warp my mind, should I not then have found\\r\\nsomething more definite to go upon? Of course I should. Sit down on this\\r\\nbench, Watson, until a train for Chiselhurst arrives, and allow me to\\r\\nlay the evidence before you, imploring you in the first instance to\\r\\ndismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her\\r\\nmistress may have said must necessarily be true. The lady’s charming\\r\\npersonality must not be permitted to warp our judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely there are details in her story which, if we looked at in cold\\r\\nblood, would excite our suspicion. These burglars made a considerable\\r\\nhaul at Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them and of their\\r\\nappearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who\\r\\nwished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part.\\r\\nAs a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business\\r\\nare, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet\\r\\nwithout embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, it is unusual\\r\\nfor burglars to operate at so early an hour, it is unusual for burglars\\r\\nto strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that\\r\\nwas the sure way to make her scream, it is unusual for them to commit\\r\\nmurder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man, it is\\r\\nunusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was\\r\\nmuch more within their reach, and finally, I should say, that it was\\r\\nvery unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these\\r\\nunusuals strike you, Watson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Their cumulative effect is certainly considerable, and yet each of them\\r\\nis quite possible in itself. The most unusual thing of all, as it seems\\r\\nto me, is that the lady should be tied to the chair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I am not so clear about that, Watson, for it is evident that they\\r\\nmust either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could\\r\\nnot give immediate notice of their escape. But at any rate I have shown,\\r\\nhave I not, that there is a certain element of improbability about the\\r\\nlady’s story? And now, on the top of this, comes the incident of the\\r\\nwineglasses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What about the wineglasses?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can you see them in your mind’s eye?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I see them clearly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are told that three men drank from them. Does that strike you as\\r\\nlikely?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not? There was wine in each glass.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly, but there was beeswing only in one glass. You must have\\r\\nnoticed that fact. What does that suggest to your mind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. The bottle was full of it, and it is inconceivable that\\r\\nthe first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it.\\r\\nThere are two possible explanations, and only two. One is that after the\\r\\nsecond glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated, and so the\\r\\nthird glass received the beeswing. That does not appear probable. No,\\r\\nno, I am sure that I am right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What, then, do you suppose?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That only two glasses were used, and that the dregs of both were poured\\r\\ninto a third glass, so as to give the false impression that three people\\r\\nhad been here. In that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass,\\r\\nwould it not? Yes, I am convinced that this is so. But if I have hit\\r\\nupon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon, then in\\r\\nan instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly\\r\\nremarkable, for it can only mean that Lady Brackenstall and her maid\\r\\nhave deliberately lied to us, that not one word of their story is to be\\r\\nbelieved, that they have some very strong reason for covering the real\\r\\ncriminal, and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any\\r\\nhelp from them. That is the mission which now lies before us, and here,\\r\\nWatson, is the Sydenham train.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe household at the Abbey Grange were much surprised at our return, but\\r\\nSherlock Holmes, finding that Stanley Hopkins had gone off to report to\\r\\nheadquarters, took possession of the dining-room, locked the door upon\\r\\nthe inside, and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute\\r\\nand laborious investigations which form the solid basis on which his\\r\\nbrilliant edifices of deduction were reared. Seated in a corner like an\\r\\ninterested student who observes the demonstration of his professor,\\r\\nI followed every step of that remarkable research. The window, the\\r\\ncurtains, the carpet, the chair, the rope--each in turn was minutely\\r\\nexamined and duly pondered. The body of the unfortunate baronet had\\r\\nbeen removed, and all else remained as we had seen it in the morning.\\r\\nFinally, to my astonishment, Holmes climbed up on to the massive\\r\\nmantelpiece. Far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which\\r\\nwere still attached to the wire. For a long time he gazed upward at it,\\r\\nand then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a\\r\\nwooden bracket on the wall. This brought his hand within a few inches of\\r\\nthe broken end of the rope, but it was not this so much as the bracket\\r\\nitself which seemed to engage his attention. Finally, he sprang down\\r\\nwith an ejaculation of satisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s all right, Watson,” said he. “We have got our case--one of the\\r\\nmost remarkable in our collection. But, dear me, how slow-witted I have\\r\\nbeen, and how nearly I have committed the blunder of my lifetime! Now, I\\r\\nthink that, with a few missing links, my chain is almost complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have got your men?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Man, Watson, man. Only one, but a very formidable person. Strong as a\\r\\nlion--witness the blow that bent that poker! Six foot three in height,\\r\\nactive as a squirrel, dexterous with his fingers, finally, remarkably\\r\\nquick-witted, for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction. Yes,\\r\\nWatson, we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual.\\r\\nAnd yet, in that bell-rope, he has given us a clue which should not have\\r\\nleft us a doubt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where was the clue?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if you were to pull down a bell-rope, Watson, where would you\\r\\nexpect it to break? Surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire.\\r\\nWhy should it break three inches from the top, as this one has done?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because it is frayed there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. This end, which we can examine, is frayed. He was cunning\\r\\nenough to do that with his knife. But the other end is not frayed. You\\r\\ncould not observe that from here, but if you were on the mantelpiece you\\r\\nwould see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever.\\r\\nYou can reconstruct what occurred. The man needed the rope. He would not\\r\\ntear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell. What did\\r\\nhe do? He sprang up on the mantelpiece, could not quite reach it, put\\r\\nhis knee on the bracket--you will see the impression in the dust--and so\\r\\ngot his knife to bear upon the cord. I could not reach the place by at\\r\\nleast three inches--from which I infer that he is at least three inches\\r\\na bigger man than I. Look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair!\\r\\nWhat is it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Blood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly it is blood. This alone puts the lady’s story out of court.\\r\\nIf she were seated on the chair when the crime was done, how comes\\r\\nthat mark? No, no, she was placed in the chair AFTER the death of her\\r\\nhusband. I’ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to\\r\\nthis. We have not yet met our Waterloo, Watson, but this is our Marengo,\\r\\nfor it begins in defeat and ends in victory. I should like now to have\\r\\na few words with the nurse, Theresa. We must be wary for a while, if we\\r\\nare to get the information which we want.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe was an interesting person, this stern Australian nurse--taciturn,\\r\\nsuspicious, ungracious, it took some time before Holmes’s pleasant\\r\\nmanner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a\\r\\ncorresponding amiability. She did not attempt to conceal her hatred for\\r\\nher late employer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, it is true that he threw the decanter at me. I heard him call\\r\\nmy mistress a name, and I told him that he would not dare to speak so if\\r\\nher brother had been there. Then it was that he threw it at me. He\\r\\nmight have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone. He was\\r\\nforever ill-treating her, and she too proud to complain. She will not\\r\\neven tell me all that he has done to her. She never told me of those\\r\\nmarks on her arm that you saw this morning, but I know very well that\\r\\nthey come from a stab with a hatpin. The sly devil--God forgive me that\\r\\nI should speak of him so, now that he is dead! But a devil he was, if\\r\\never one walked the earth. He was all honey when first we met him--only\\r\\neighteen months ago, and we both feel as if it were eighteen years. She\\r\\nhad only just arrived in London. Yes, it was her first voyage--she had\\r\\nnever been from home before. He won her with his title and his money\\r\\nand his false London ways. If she made a mistake she has paid for it,\\r\\nif ever a woman did. What month did we meet him? Well, I tell you it was\\r\\njust after we arrived. We arrived in June, and it was July. They were\\r\\nmarried in January of last year. Yes, she is down in the morning-room\\r\\nagain, and I have no doubt she will see you, but you must not ask too\\r\\nmuch of her, for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will\\r\\nstand.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLady Brackenstall was reclining on the same couch, but looked brighter\\r\\nthan before. The maid had entered with us, and began once more to foment\\r\\nthe bruise upon her mistress’s brow.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hope,” said the lady, “that you have not come to cross-examine me\\r\\nagain?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No,” Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, “I will not cause you any\\r\\nunnecessary trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire is to make\\r\\nthings easy for you, for I am convinced that you are a much-tried woman.\\r\\nIf you will treat me as a friend and trust me, you may find that I will\\r\\njustify your trust.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you want me to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To tell me the truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, Lady Brackenstall--it is no use. You may have heard of any\\r\\nlittle reputation which I possess. I will stake it all on the fact that\\r\\nyour story is an absolute fabrication.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMistress and maid were both staring at Holmes with pale faces and\\r\\nfrightened eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are an impudent fellow!” cried Theresa. “Do you mean to say that my\\r\\nmistress has told a lie?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you nothing to tell me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have told you everything.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Think once more, Lady Brackenstall. Would it not be better to be\\r\\nfrank?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face. Then some new\\r\\nstrong thought caused it to set like a mask.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have told you all I know.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders. “I am sorry,” he said,\\r\\nand without another word we left the room and the house. There was a\\r\\npond in the park, and to this my friend led the way. It was frozen\\r\\nover, but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary\\r\\nswan. Holmes gazed at it, and then passed on to the lodge gate. There\\r\\nhe scribbled a short note for Stanley Hopkins, and left it with the\\r\\nlodge-keeper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It may be a hit, or it may be a miss, but we are bound to do something\\r\\nfor friend Hopkins, just to justify this second visit,” said he. “I will\\r\\nnot quite take him into my confidence yet. I think our next scene of\\r\\noperations must be the shipping office of the Adelaide-Southampton line,\\r\\nwhich stands at the end of Pall Mall, if I remember right. There is a\\r\\nsecond line of steamers which connect South Australia with England, but\\r\\nwe will draw the larger cover first.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention, and he\\r\\nwas not long in acquiring all the information he needed. In June of\\r\\n‘95, only one of their line had reached a home port. It was the ROCK\\r\\nOF GIBRALTAR, their largest and best boat. A reference to the passenger\\r\\nlist showed that Miss Fraser, of Adelaide, with her maid had made the\\r\\nvoyage in her. The boat was now somewhere south of the Suez Canal on\\r\\nher way to Australia. Her officers were the same as in ‘95, with one\\r\\nexception. The first officer, Mr. Jack Crocker, had been made a captain\\r\\nand was to take charge of their new ship, the BASS ROCK, sailing in two\\r\\ndays’ time from Southampton. He lived at Sydenham, but he was likely to\\r\\nbe in that morning for instructions, if we cared to wait for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, Mr. Holmes had no desire to see him, but would be glad to know more\\r\\nabout his record and character.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis record was magnificent. There was not an officer in the fleet to\\r\\ntouch him. As to his character, he was reliable on duty, but a wild,\\r\\ndesperate fellow off the deck of his ship--hot-headed, excitable, but\\r\\nloyal, honest, and kind-hearted. That was the pith of the information\\r\\nwith which Holmes left the office of the Adelaide-Southampton company.\\r\\nThence he drove to Scotland Yard, but, instead of entering, he sat in\\r\\nhis cab with his brows drawn down, lost in profound thought. Finally he\\r\\ndrove round to the Charing Cross telegraph office, sent off a message,\\r\\nand then, at last, we made for Baker Street once more.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, I couldn’t do it, Watson,” said he, as we reentered our room. “Once\\r\\nthat warrant was made out, nothing on earth would save him. Once\\r\\nor twice in my career I feel that I have done more real harm by my\\r\\ndiscovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime. I have\\r\\nlearned caution now, and I had rather play tricks with the law of\\r\\nEngland than with my own conscience. Let us know a little more before we\\r\\nact.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore evening, we had a visit from Inspector Stanley Hopkins. Things\\r\\nwere not going very well with him.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe that you are a wizard, Mr. Holmes. I really do sometimes\\r\\nthink that you have powers that are not human. Now, how on earth could\\r\\nyou know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you told me to examine it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You got it, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I got it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am very glad if I have helped you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But you haven’t helped me. You have made the affair far more difficult.\\r\\nWhat sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into\\r\\nthe nearest pond?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was certainly rather eccentric behaviour. I was merely going on\\r\\nthe idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not\\r\\nwant it--who merely took it for a blind, as it were--then they would\\r\\nnaturally be anxious to get rid of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why should such an idea cross your mind?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I thought it was possible. When they came out through the French\\r\\nwindow, there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice,\\r\\nright in front of their noses. Could there be a better hiding-place?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, a hiding-place--that is better!” cried Stanley Hopkins. “Yes, yes,\\r\\nI see it all now! It was early, there were folk upon the roads, they\\r\\nwere afraid of being seen with the silver, so they sank it in the pond,\\r\\nintending to return for it when the coast was clear. Excellent, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes--that is better than your idea of a blind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so, you have got an admirable theory. I have no doubt that my\\r\\nown ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in\\r\\ndiscovering the silver.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir--yes. It was all your doing. But I have had a bad setback.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A setback?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes. The Randall gang were arrested in New York this\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dear me, Hopkins! That is certainly rather against your theory that\\r\\nthey committed a murder in Kent last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is fatal, Mr. Holmes--absolutely fatal. Still, there are other gangs\\r\\nof three besides the Randalls, or it may be some new gang of which the\\r\\npolice have never heard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so, it is perfectly possible. What, are you off?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, Mr. Holmes, there is no rest for me until I have got to the bottom\\r\\nof the business. I suppose you have no hint to give me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have given you one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Which?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I suggested a blind.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why, Mr. Holmes, why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that’s the question, of course. But I commend the idea to your\\r\\nmind. You might possibly find that there was something in it. You won’t\\r\\nstop for dinner? Well, good-bye, and let us know how you get on.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDinner was over, and the table cleared before Holmes alluded to the\\r\\nmatter again. He had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the\\r\\ncheerful blaze of the fire. Suddenly he looked at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I expect developments, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now--within a few minutes. I dare say you thought I acted rather badly\\r\\nto Stanley Hopkins just now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I trust your judgment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A very sensible reply, Watson. You must look at it this way: what\\r\\nI know is unofficial, what he knows is official. I have the right to\\r\\nprivate judgment, but he has none. He must disclose all, or he is a\\r\\ntraitor to his service. In a doubtful case I would not put him in so\\r\\npainful a position, and so I reserve my information until my own mind is\\r\\nclear upon the matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But when will that be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The time has come. You will now be present at the last scene of a\\r\\nremarkable little drama.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a sound upon the stairs, and our door was opened to admit as\\r\\nfine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it. He was a very\\r\\ntall young man, golden-moustached, blue-eyed, with a skin which had been\\r\\nburned by tropical suns, and a springy step, which showed that the huge\\r\\nframe was as active as it was strong. He closed the door behind him, and\\r\\nthen he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast, choking down some\\r\\novermastering emotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sit down, Captain Crocker. You got my telegram?”\\r\\n\\r\\nOur visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the other of us\\r\\nwith questioning eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I got your telegram, and I came at the hour you said. I heard that you\\r\\nhad been down to the office. There was no getting away from you. Let’s\\r\\nhear the worst. What are you going to do with me? Arrest me? Speak out,\\r\\nman! You can’t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give him a cigar,” said Holmes. “Bite on that, Captain Crocker, and\\r\\ndon’t let your nerves run away with you. I should not sit here smoking\\r\\nwith you if I thought that you were a common criminal, you may be sure\\r\\nof that. Be frank with me and we may do some good. Play tricks with me,\\r\\nand I’ll crush you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you wish me to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To give me a true account of all that happened at the Abbey Grange last\\r\\nnight--a TRUE account, mind you, with nothing added and nothing taken\\r\\noff. I know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight,\\r\\nI’ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of\\r\\nmy hands forever.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor thought for a little. Then he struck his leg with his great\\r\\nsunburned hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll chance it,” he cried. “I believe you are a man of your word, and\\r\\na white man, and I’ll tell you the whole story. But one thing I will say\\r\\nfirst. So far as I am concerned, I regret nothing and I fear nothing,\\r\\nand I would do it all again and be proud of the job. Damn the beast, if\\r\\nhe had as many lives as a cat, he would owe them all to me! But it’s\\r\\nthe lady, Mary--Mary Fraser--for never will I call her by that accursed\\r\\nname. When I think of getting her into trouble, I who would give my life\\r\\njust to bring one smile to her dear face, it’s that that turns my soul\\r\\ninto water. And yet--and yet--what less could I do? I’ll tell you my\\r\\nstory, gentlemen, and then I’ll ask you, as man to man, what less could\\r\\nI do?\\r\\n\\r\\n“I must go back a bit. You seem to know everything, so I expect that you\\r\\nknow that I met her when she was a passenger and I was first officer of\\r\\nthe ROCK OF GIBRALTAR. From the first day I met her, she was the only\\r\\nwoman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time\\r\\nsince have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed\\r\\nthe deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was\\r\\nnever engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated\\r\\na man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all\\r\\ngood comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free\\r\\nwoman, but I could never again be a free man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Next time I came back from sea, I heard of her marriage. Well, why\\r\\nshouldn’t she marry whom she liked? Title and money--who could carry\\r\\nthem better than she? She was born for all that is beautiful and dainty.\\r\\nI didn’t grieve over her marriage. I was not such a selfish hound as\\r\\nthat. I just rejoiced that good luck had come her way, and that she had\\r\\nnot thrown herself away on a penniless sailor. That’s how I loved Mary\\r\\nFraser.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I never thought to see her again, but last voyage I was promoted,\\r\\nand the new boat was not yet launched, so I had to wait for a couple of\\r\\nmonths with my people at Sydenham. One day out in a country lane I met\\r\\nTheresa Wright, her old maid. She told me all about her, about him,\\r\\nabout everything. I tell you, gentlemen, it nearly drove me mad. This\\r\\ndrunken hound, that he should dare to raise his hand to her, whose\\r\\nboots he was not worthy to lick! I met Theresa again. Then I met Mary\\r\\nherself--and met her again. Then she would meet me no more. But the\\r\\nother day I had a notice that I was to start on my voyage within a week,\\r\\nand I determined that I would see her once before I left. Theresa was\\r\\nalways my friend, for she loved Mary and hated this villain almost as\\r\\nmuch as I did. From her I learned the ways of the house. Mary used to\\r\\nsit up reading in her own little room downstairs. I crept round there\\r\\nlast night and scratched at the window. At first she would not open to\\r\\nme, but in her heart I know that now she loves me, and she could not\\r\\nleave me in the frosty night. She whispered to me to come round to the\\r\\nbig front window, and I found it open before me, so as to let me into\\r\\nthe dining-room. Again I heard from her own lips things that made my\\r\\nblood boil, and again I cursed this brute who mishandled the woman I\\r\\nloved. Well, gentlemen, I was standing with her just inside the window,\\r\\nin all innocence, as God is my judge, when he rushed like a madman into\\r\\nthe room, called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman,\\r\\nand welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand. I had\\r\\nsprung for the poker, and it was a fair fight between us. See here,\\r\\non my arm, where his first blow fell. Then it was my turn, and I went\\r\\nthrough him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin. Do you think I was\\r\\nsorry? Not I! It was his life or mine, but far more than that, it was\\r\\nhis life or hers, for how could I leave her in the power of this madman?\\r\\nThat was how I killed him. Was I wrong? Well, then, what would either of\\r\\nyou gentlemen have done, if you had been in my position?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She had screamed when he struck her, and that brought old Theresa down\\r\\nfrom the room above. There was a bottle of wine on the sideboard, and I\\r\\nopened it and poured a little between Mary’s lips, for she was half dead\\r\\nwith shock. Then I took a drop myself. Theresa was as cool as ice, and\\r\\nit was her plot as much as mine. We must make it appear that burglars\\r\\nhad done the thing. Theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress,\\r\\nwhile I swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell. Then I lashed her in\\r\\nher chair, and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural,\\r\\nelse they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up\\r\\nthere to cut it. Then I gathered up a few plates and pots of silver, to\\r\\ncarry out the idea of the robbery, and there I left them, with orders\\r\\nto give the alarm when I had a quarter of an hour’s start. I dropped the\\r\\nsilver into the pond, and made off for Sydenham, feeling that for once\\r\\nin my life I had done a real good night’s work. And that’s the truth and\\r\\nthe whole truth, Mr. Holmes, if it costs me my neck.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes smoked for some time in silence. Then he crossed the room, and\\r\\nshook our visitor by the hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what I think,” said he. “I know that every word is true, for you\\r\\nhave hardly said a word which I did not know. No one but an acrobat or a\\r\\nsailor could have got up to that bell-rope from the bracket, and no one\\r\\nbut a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened\\r\\nto the chair. Only once had this lady been brought into contact with\\r\\nsailors, and that was on her voyage, and it was someone of her own class\\r\\nof life, since she was trying hard to shield him, and so showing that\\r\\nshe loved him. You see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you\\r\\nwhen once I had started upon the right trail.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought the police never could have seen through our dodge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the police haven’t, nor will they, to the best of my belief. Now,\\r\\nlook here, Captain Crocker, this is a very serious matter, though I am\\r\\nwilling to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to\\r\\nwhich any man could be subjected. I am not sure that in defence of your\\r\\nown life your action will not be pronounced legitimate. However, that is\\r\\nfor a British jury to decide. Meanwhile I have so much sympathy for you\\r\\nthat, if you choose to disappear in the next twenty-four hours, I will\\r\\npromise you that no one will hinder you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then it will all come out?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly it will come out.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sailor flushed with anger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of proposal is that to make a man? I know enough of law to\\r\\nunderstand that Mary would be held as accomplice. Do you think I would\\r\\nleave her alone to face the music while I slunk away? No, sir, let them\\r\\ndo their worst upon me, but for heaven’s sake, Mr. Holmes, find some way\\r\\nof keeping my poor Mary out of the courts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was only testing you, and you ring true every time. Well, it is a\\r\\ngreat responsibility that I take upon myself, but I have given Hopkins\\r\\nan excellent hint and if he can’t avail himself of it I can do no more.\\r\\nSee here, Captain Crocker, we’ll do this in due form of law. You are the\\r\\nprisoner. Watson, you are a British jury, and I never met a man who was\\r\\nmore eminently fitted to represent one. I am the judge. Now, gentleman\\r\\nof the jury, you have heard the evidence. Do you find the prisoner\\r\\nguilty or not guilty?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not guilty, my lord,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“VOX POPULI, VOX DEI. You are acquitted, Captain Crocker. So long as the\\r\\nlaw does not find some other victim you are safe from me. Come back\\r\\nto this lady in a year, and may her future and yours justify us in the\\r\\njudgment which we have pronounced this night!”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had intended “The Adventure of the Abbey Grange” to be the last of\\r\\nthose exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever\\r\\ncommunicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any\\r\\nlack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which\\r\\nI have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the\\r\\npart of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of\\r\\nthis remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr.\\r\\nHolmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences.\\r\\nSo long as he was in actual professional practice the records of\\r\\nhis successes were of some practical value to him, but since he\\r\\nhas definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and\\r\\nbee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him,\\r\\nand he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should\\r\\nbe strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I\\r\\nhad given a promise that “The Adventure of the Second Stain” should be\\r\\npublished when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is\\r\\nonly appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in\\r\\nthe most important international case which he has ever been called\\r\\nupon to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a\\r\\ncarefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before\\r\\nthe public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in\\r\\ncertain details, the public will readily understand that there is an\\r\\nexcellent reason for my reticence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless,\\r\\nthat upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of\\r\\nEuropean fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street. The\\r\\none, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than\\r\\nthe illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other,\\r\\ndark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with\\r\\nevery beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable Trelawney\\r\\nHope, Secretary for European Affairs, and the most rising statesman in\\r\\nthe country. They sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee,\\r\\nand it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was\\r\\nbusiness of the most pressing importance which had brought them. The\\r\\nPremier’s thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory\\r\\nhead of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from\\r\\nHolmes to me. The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache\\r\\nand fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o’clock this\\r\\nmorning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his suggestion\\r\\nthat we have both come to you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you informed the police?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir,” said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for\\r\\nwhich he was famous. “We have not done so, nor is it possible that we\\r\\nshould do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform\\r\\nthe public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And why, sir?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because the document in question is of such immense importance that\\r\\nits publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead to\\r\\nEuropean complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to say\\r\\nthat peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be\\r\\nattended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered\\r\\nat all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its\\r\\ncontents should be generally known.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if\\r\\nyou would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document\\r\\ndisappeared.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it\\r\\nwas a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It was\\r\\nof such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but have taken\\r\\nit across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept it in\\r\\nmy bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last night. Of that\\r\\nI am certain. I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner\\r\\nand saw the document inside. This morning it was gone. The despatch-box\\r\\nhad stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. I am a\\r\\nlight sleeper, and so is my wife. We are both prepared to swear that no\\r\\none could have entered the room during the night. And yet I repeat that\\r\\nthe paper is gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time did you dine?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Half-past seven.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How long was it before you went to bed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was half-past\\r\\neleven before we went to our room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house-maid in the\\r\\nmorning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest of the day.\\r\\nThey are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time.\\r\\nBesides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was\\r\\nanything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my\\r\\ndespatch-box.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who did know of the existence of that letter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No one in the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely your wife knew?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir. I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Premier nodded approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,” said\\r\\nhe. “I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it\\r\\nwould rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Secretary bowed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never\\r\\nbreathed one word to my wife upon this matter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Could she have guessed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have\\r\\nguessed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you lost any documents before?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday, but the pledge\\r\\nof secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the\\r\\nsolemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good heavens,\\r\\nto think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!” His\\r\\nhandsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands\\r\\ntore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man,\\r\\nimpulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask was\\r\\nreplaced, and the gentle voice had returned. “Besides the members of\\r\\nthe Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who\\r\\nknow of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But abroad?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. I\\r\\nam well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official channels\\r\\nhave not been employed.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes considered for some little time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is, and\\r\\nwhy its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier’s shaggy\\r\\neyebrows gathered in a frown.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. There\\r\\nis a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is addressed in\\r\\nlarge, bold handwriting to----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fear, sir,” said Holmes, “that, interesting and indeed essential as\\r\\nthese details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. What\\r\\nWAS the letter?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I\\r\\ncannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of the\\r\\npowers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as\\r\\nI describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your\\r\\ncountry, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes rose with a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are two of the most busy men in the country,” said he, “and in\\r\\nmy own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret\\r\\nexceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation\\r\\nof this interview would be a waste of time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his\\r\\ndeep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. “I am not accustomed,\\r\\nsir,” he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. For a\\r\\nminute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old statesman shrugged\\r\\nhis shoulders.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and\\r\\nit is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our\\r\\nentire confidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I agree with you,” said the younger statesman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of\\r\\nyour colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for\\r\\nI could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this\\r\\naffair should come out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may safely trust us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been\\r\\nruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It\\r\\nhas been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.\\r\\nInquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.\\r\\nAt the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain\\r\\nphrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication\\r\\nwould undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this\\r\\ncountry. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to\\r\\nsay that within a week of the publication of that letter this country\\r\\nwould be involved in a great war.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may well\\r\\nmean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred\\r\\nthousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you informed the sender?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands\\r\\nthat he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a\\r\\ngreater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to\\r\\ncome out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?\\r\\nWhy should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international\\r\\npolitics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no\\r\\ndifficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed\\r\\ncamp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military\\r\\npower. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into\\r\\nwar with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other\\r\\nconfederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate\\r\\nto secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his\\r\\ncountry and ours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an\\r\\nenemy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding on\\r\\nits way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. The\\r\\nPremier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There is\\r\\nno precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full\\r\\npossession of the facts. What course do you recommend?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes shook his head mournfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be\\r\\nwar?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think it is very probable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, sir, prepare for war.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after\\r\\neleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife\\r\\nwere both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out.\\r\\nIt was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and\\r\\neleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it\\r\\nevidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early\\r\\nas possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at\\r\\nthat hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to retain it. It\\r\\nhas been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now\\r\\nto overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our reach.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister rose from the settee.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the matter\\r\\nis indeed out of our hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let us presume, for argument’s sake, that the document was taken by the\\r\\nmaid or by the valet----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are both old and tried servants.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that\\r\\nthere is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go\\r\\nup unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it.\\r\\nTo whom would the thief take it? To one of several international spies\\r\\nand secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. There are\\r\\nthree who may be said to be the heads of their profession. I will begin\\r\\nmy research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post.\\r\\nIf one is missing--especially if he has disappeared since last night--we\\r\\nwill have some indication as to where the document has gone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why should he be missing?” asked the European Secretary. “He would take\\r\\nthe letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations with\\r\\nthe Embassies are often strained.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a prize\\r\\nto headquarters with his own hands. I think that your course of action\\r\\nis an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our other\\r\\nduties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any fresh\\r\\ndevelopments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will\\r\\nno doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in\\r\\nsilence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened\\r\\nthe morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had\\r\\noccurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation,\\r\\nsprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said he, “there is no better way of approaching it. The situation\\r\\nis desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure which of\\r\\nthem has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of\\r\\nhis hands. After all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and\\r\\nI have the British treasury behind me. If it’s on the market I’ll buy\\r\\nit--if it means another penny on the income-tax. It is conceivable\\r\\nthat the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this\\r\\nside before he tries his luck on the other. There are only those three\\r\\ncapable of playing so bold a game--there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and\\r\\nEduardo Lucas. I will see each of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at my morning paper.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will not see him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He was murdered in his house last night.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures\\r\\nthat it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I\\r\\nhad astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the\\r\\npaper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in\\r\\nreading when he rose from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMURDER IN WESTMINSTER\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16 Godolphin\\r\\nStreet, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth century\\r\\nhouses which lie between the river and the Abbey, almost in the shadow\\r\\nof the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament. This small but select\\r\\nmansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well\\r\\nknown in society circles both on account of his charming personality\\r\\nand because he has the well-deserved reputation of being one of the\\r\\nbest amateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man,\\r\\nthirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists of Mrs.\\r\\nPringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mitton, his valet. The former\\r\\nretires early and sleeps at the top of the house. The valet was out for\\r\\nthe evening, visiting a friend at Hammersmith. From ten o’clock onward\\r\\nMr. Lucas had the house to himself. What occurred during that time has\\r\\nnot yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett,\\r\\npassing along Godolphin Street observed that the door of No. 16 was\\r\\najar. He knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the\\r\\nfront room, he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without\\r\\nreply. He then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state\\r\\nof wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one\\r\\nchair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still\\r\\ngrasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He\\r\\nhad been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife\\r\\nwith which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,\\r\\nplucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the\\r\\nwalls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for\\r\\nthere had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room.\\r\\nMr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and\\r\\nmysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a\\r\\nwidespread circle of friends.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, Watson, what do you make of this?” asked Holmes, after a long\\r\\npause.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is an amazing coincidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as\\r\\npossible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the\\r\\nvery hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The odds are\\r\\nenormous against its being coincidence. No figures could express them.\\r\\nNo, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--MUST be connected. It\\r\\nis for us to find the connection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But now the official police must know all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They know--and\\r\\nshall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only WE know of both events,\\r\\nand can trace the relation between them. There is one obvious point\\r\\nwhich would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas.\\r\\nGodolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes’ walk from\\r\\nWhitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have named live in\\r\\nthe extreme West End. It was easier, therefore, for Lucas than for the\\r\\nothers to establish a connection or receive a message from the\\r\\nEuropean Secretary’s household--a small thing, and yet where events are\\r\\ncompressed into a few hours it may prove essential. Halloa! what have we\\r\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady’s card upon her salver. Holmes\\r\\nglanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up,”\\r\\n said he.\\r\\n\\r\\nA moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that\\r\\nmorning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman\\r\\nin London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of\\r\\nthe Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation\\r\\nof colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate\\r\\ncharm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as\\r\\nwe saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the\\r\\nfirst thing to impress the observer. The cheek was lovely but it was\\r\\npaled with emotion, the eyes were bright but it was the brightness\\r\\nof fever, the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after\\r\\nself-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang first to the eye as\\r\\nour fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, madam, he has been here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes. I implore you not to tell him that I came here.” Holmes\\r\\nbowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you\\r\\nwill sit down and tell me what you desire, but I fear that I cannot make\\r\\nany unconditional promise.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the\\r\\nwindow. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely\\r\\nwomanly. “Mr. Holmes,” she said--and her white-gloved hands clasped and\\r\\nunclasped as she spoke--“I will speak frankly to you in the hopes\\r\\nthat it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete\\r\\nconfidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That one\\r\\nis politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing. Now, I\\r\\nam aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last\\r\\nnight. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because the matter is\\r\\npolitical my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence.\\r\\nNow it is essential--essential, I say--that I should thoroughly\\r\\nunderstand it. You are the only other person, save only these\\r\\npoliticians, who knows the true facts. I beg you then, Mr. Holmes, to\\r\\ntell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to. Tell me all,\\r\\nMr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client’s interests keep you silent,\\r\\nfor I assure you that his interests, if he would only see it, would be\\r\\nbest served by taking me into his complete confidence. What was this\\r\\npaper which was stolen?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe groaned and sank her face in her hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to keep\\r\\nyou in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the\\r\\ntrue facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has\\r\\nwithheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom you must ask.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your\\r\\ntelling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if\\r\\nyou would enlighten me on one point.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, madam?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is my husband’s political career likely to suffer through this\\r\\nincident?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very\\r\\nunfortunate effect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah!” She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband\\r\\ndropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible\\r\\npublic consequences might arise from the loss of this document.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of what nature are they?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I will take up no more of your time. I cannot blame you, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side\\r\\nwill not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even\\r\\nagainst his will, to share my husband’s anxieties. Once more I beg that\\r\\nyou will say nothing of my visit.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked back at us from the door, and I had a last impression of that\\r\\nbeautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she\\r\\nwas gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department,” said Holmes, with a\\r\\nsmile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam\\r\\nof the front door. “What was the fair lady’s game? What did she really\\r\\nwant?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hum! Think of her appearance, Watson--her manner, her suppressed\\r\\nexcitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. Remember\\r\\nthat she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was certainly much moved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it\\r\\nwas best for her husband that she should know all. What did she mean by\\r\\nthat? And you must have observed, Watson, how she manoeuvred to have the\\r\\nlight at her back. She did not wish us to read her expression.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, she chose the one chair in the room.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the\\r\\nwoman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her\\r\\nnose--that proved to be the correct solution. How can you build on such\\r\\na quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most\\r\\nextraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs.\\r\\nGood-morning, Watson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are off?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I will while away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends\\r\\nof the regular establishment. With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of\\r\\nour problem, though I must admit that I have not an inkling as to what\\r\\nform it may take. It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of\\r\\nthe facts. Do you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive any fresh\\r\\nvisitors. I’ll join you at lunch if I am able.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAll that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his\\r\\nfriends would call taciturn, and others morose. He ran out and ran in,\\r\\nsmoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries,\\r\\ndevoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual\\r\\nquestions which I put to him. It was evident to me that things were not\\r\\ngoing well with him or his quest. He would say nothing of the case, and\\r\\nit was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest,\\r\\nand the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton, the valet of\\r\\nthe deceased. The coroner’s jury brought in the obvious Wilful Murder,\\r\\nbut the parties remained as unknown as ever. No motive was suggested.\\r\\nThe room was full of articles of value, but none had been taken. The\\r\\ndead man’s papers had not been tampered with. They were carefully\\r\\nexamined, and showed that he was a keen student of international\\r\\npolitics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an\\r\\nuntiring letter writer. He had been on intimate terms with the leading\\r\\npoliticians of several countries. But nothing sensational was discovered\\r\\namong the documents which filled his drawers. As to his relations with\\r\\nwomen, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. He had\\r\\nmany acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he\\r\\nloved. His habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. His death was\\r\\nan absolute mystery and likely to remain so.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it was a council of despair\\r\\nas an alternative to absolute inaction. But no case could be sustained\\r\\nagainst him. He had visited friends in Hammersmith that night. The ALIBI\\r\\nwas complete. It is true that he started home at an hour which should\\r\\nhave brought him to Westminster before the time when the crime was\\r\\ndiscovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way\\r\\nseemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. He had\\r\\nactually arrived at twelve o’clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed\\r\\nby the unexpected tragedy. He had always been on good terms with his\\r\\nmaster. Several of the dead man’s possessions--notably a small case of\\r\\nrazors--had been found in the valet’s boxes, but he explained that they\\r\\nhad been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to\\r\\ncorroborate the story. Mitton had been in Lucas’s employment for three\\r\\nyears. It was noticeable that Lucas did not take Mitton on the Continent\\r\\nwith him. Sometimes he visited Paris for three months on end, but Mitton\\r\\nwas left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. As to the housekeeper,\\r\\nshe had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a\\r\\nvisitor he had himself admitted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow it\\r\\nin the papers. If Holmes knew more, he kept his own counsel, but, as\\r\\nhe told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his\\r\\nconfidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every\\r\\ndevelopment. Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from\\r\\nParis which seemed to solve the whole question.\\r\\n\\r\\nA discovery has just been made by the Parisian police [said the DAILY\\r\\nTELEGRAPH] which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of\\r\\nMr. Eduardo Lucas, who met his death by violence last Monday night\\r\\nat Godolphin Street, Westminster. Our readers will remember that\\r\\nthe deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some\\r\\nsuspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an\\r\\nALIBI. Yesterday a lady, who has been known as Mme. Henri Fournaye,\\r\\noccupying a small villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported to the\\r\\nauthorities by her servants as being insane. An examination showed\\r\\nshe had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form.\\r\\nOn inquiry, the police have discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye only\\r\\nreturned from a journey to London on Tuesday last, and there is\\r\\nevidence to connect her with the crime at Westminster. A comparison of\\r\\nphotographs has proved conclusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Eduardo\\r\\nLucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for\\r\\nsome reason lived a double life in London and Paris. Mme. Fournaye,\\r\\nwho is of Creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has\\r\\nsuffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to\\r\\nfrenzy. It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed\\r\\nthe terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in London. Her\\r\\nmovements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced, but it is\\r\\nundoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much\\r\\nattention at Charing Cross Station on Tuesday morning by the wildness\\r\\nof her appearance and the violence of her gestures. It is probable,\\r\\ntherefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that\\r\\nits immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. At\\r\\npresent she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the\\r\\ndoctors hold out no hopes of the reestablishment of her reason. There is\\r\\nevidence that a woman, who might have been Mme. Fournaye, was seen for\\r\\nsome hours upon Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of that, Holmes?” I had read the account aloud to\\r\\nhim, while he finished his breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear Watson,” said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and\\r\\ndown the room, “You are most long-suffering, but if I have told you\\r\\nnothing in the last three days, it is because there is nothing to tell.\\r\\nEven now this report from Paris does not help us much.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely it is final as regards the man’s death.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man’s death is a mere incident--a trivial episode--in comparison\\r\\nwith our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European\\r\\ncatastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the last three\\r\\ndays, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly\\r\\nfrom the government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there\\r\\nany sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose--no, it CAN’T be\\r\\nloose--but if it isn’t loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it\\r\\nheld back? That’s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was\\r\\nit, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night\\r\\nwhen the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why\\r\\nis it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with\\r\\nher? If so, is it in her house in Paris? How could I search for it\\r\\nwithout the French police having their suspicions aroused? It is a case,\\r\\nmy dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals\\r\\nare. Every man’s hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake\\r\\nare colossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion, it will\\r\\ncertainly represent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my\\r\\nlatest from the front!” He glanced hurriedly at the note which had\\r\\nbeen handed in. “Halloa! Lestrade seems to have observed something of\\r\\ninterest. Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to\\r\\nWestminster.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my first visit to the scene of the crime--a high, dingy,\\r\\nnarrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which\\r\\ngave it birth. Lestrade’s bulldog features gazed out at us from the\\r\\nfront window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened\\r\\nthe door and let us in. The room into which we were shown was that in\\r\\nwhich the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained save\\r\\nan ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. This carpet was a small square\\r\\ndrugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse\\r\\nof beautiful, old-fashioned wood-flooring in square blocks, highly\\r\\npolished. Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of\\r\\nwhich had been used on that tragic night. In the window was a sumptuous\\r\\nwriting-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs,\\r\\nand the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the\\r\\nverge of effeminacy.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seen the Paris news?” asked Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes nodded.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt\\r\\nit’s just as they say. She knocked at the door--surprise visit, I\\r\\nguess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments--he let her in,\\r\\ncouldn’t keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced him,\\r\\nreproached him. One thing led to another, and then with that dagger so\\r\\nhandy the end soon came. It wasn’t all done in an instant, though, for\\r\\nthese chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand as\\r\\nif he had tried to hold her off with it. We’ve got it all clear as if we\\r\\nhad seen it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet you have sent for me?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, yes, that’s another matter--a mere trifle, but the sort of thing\\r\\nyou take an interest in--queer, you know, and what you might call\\r\\nfreakish. It has nothing to do with the main fact--can’t have, on the\\r\\nface of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep\\r\\nthings in their position. Nothing has been moved. Officer in charge here\\r\\nday and night. This morning, as the man was buried and the investigation\\r\\nover--so far as this room is concerned--we thought we could tidy up\\r\\na bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down, only just laid\\r\\nthere. We had occasion to raise it. We found----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes? You found----”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes’s face grew tense with anxiety.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did\\r\\nfind. You see that stain on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have\\r\\nsoaked through, must it not?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Undoubtedly it must.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white\\r\\nwoodwork to correspond.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No stain! But there must----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, so you would say. But the fact remains that there isn’t.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he\\r\\nshowed that it was indeed as he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the under side is as stained as the upper. It must have left a\\r\\nmark.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, I’ll show you the explanation. There IS a second stain, but it\\r\\ndoes not correspond with the other. See for yourself.” As he spoke he\\r\\nturned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was\\r\\na great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned\\r\\nfloor. “What do you make of that, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is simple enough. The two stains did correspond, but the carpet\\r\\nhas been turned round. As it was square and unfastened it was easily\\r\\ndone.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The official police don’t need you, Mr. Holmes, to tell them that the\\r\\ncarpet must have been turned round. That’s clear enough, for the stains\\r\\nlie above each other--if you lay it over this way. But what I want to\\r\\nknow is, who shifted the carpet, and why?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI could see from Holmes’s rigid face that he was vibrating with inward\\r\\nexcitement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here, Lestrade,” said he, “has that constable in the passage been\\r\\nin charge of the place all the time?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, he has.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don’t do it before us.\\r\\nWe’ll wait here. You take him into the back room. You’ll be more likely\\r\\nto get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he dared to admit\\r\\npeople and leave them alone in this room. Don’t ask him if he has done\\r\\nit. Take it for granted. Tell him you KNOW someone has been here. Press\\r\\nhim. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness.\\r\\nDo exactly what I tell you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By George, if he knows I’ll have it out of him!” cried Lestrade. He\\r\\ndarted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded\\r\\nfrom the back room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, Watson, now!” cried Holmes with frenzied eagerness. All the\\r\\ndemoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out\\r\\nin a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and in an\\r\\ninstant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares\\r\\nof wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the\\r\\nedge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small black cavity\\r\\nopened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into it and drew it out\\r\\nwith a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. It was empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!” The wooden lid was replaced,\\r\\nand the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade’s voice\\r\\nwas heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning languidly against\\r\\nthe mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his\\r\\nirrepressible yawns.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes, I can see that you are bored to\\r\\ndeath with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come\\r\\nin here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable\\r\\nconduct.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I meant no harm, sir, I’m sure. The young woman came to the door last\\r\\nevening--mistook the house, she did. And then we got talking. It’s\\r\\nlonesome, when you’re on duty here all day.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, what happened then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She wanted to see where the crime was done--had read about it in the\\r\\npapers, she said. She was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman,\\r\\nsir, and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep. When she saw that\\r\\nmark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she\\r\\nwere dead. I ran to the back and got some water, but I could not bring\\r\\nher to. Then I went round the corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy,\\r\\nand by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and\\r\\nwas off--ashamed of herself, I daresay, and dared not face me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How about moving that drugget?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when I came back. You see,\\r\\nshe fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it\\r\\nin place. I straightened it out afterwards.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s a lesson to you that you can’t deceive me, Constable MacPherson,”\\r\\n said Lestrade, with dignity. “No doubt you thought that your breach of\\r\\nduty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget\\r\\nwas enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room.\\r\\nIt’s lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find\\r\\nyourself in Queer Street. I’m sorry to have called you down over such a\\r\\npetty business, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of the second stain\\r\\nnot corresponding with the first would interest you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, it was most interesting. Has this woman only been here once,\\r\\nconstable?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, only once.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who was she?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t know the name, sir. Was answering an advertisement about\\r\\ntypewriting and came to the wrong number--very pleasant, genteel young\\r\\nwoman, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Tall? Handsome?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, sir, she was a well-grown young woman. I suppose you might say\\r\\nshe was handsome. Perhaps some would say she was very handsome. ‘Oh,\\r\\nofficer, do let me have a peep!’ says she. She had pretty, coaxing ways,\\r\\nas you might say, and I thought there was no harm in letting her just\\r\\nput her head through the door.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How was she dressed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quiet, sir--a long mantle down to her feet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What time was it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was just growing dusk at the time. They were lighting the lamps as I\\r\\ncame back with the brandy.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good,” said Holmes. “Come, Watson, I think that we have more\\r\\nimportant work elsewhere.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the\\r\\nrepentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on the\\r\\nstep and held up something in his hand. The constable stared intently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good Lord, sir!” he cried, with amazement on his face. Holmes put his\\r\\nfinger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast pocket, and burst\\r\\nout laughing as we turned down the street. “Excellent!” said he. “Come,\\r\\nfriend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You will be\\r\\nrelieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable\\r\\nTrelawney Hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career, that the\\r\\nindiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion,\\r\\nthat the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal\\r\\nwith, and that with a little tact and management upon our part\\r\\nnobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly\\r\\nincident.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You have solved it!” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hardly that, Watson. There are some points which are as dark as ever.\\r\\nBut we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the\\r\\nrest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a\\r\\nhead.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for\\r\\nLady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were shown\\r\\ninto the morning-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes!” said the lady, and her face was pink with her indignation.\\r\\n“This is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. I desired,\\r\\nas I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband\\r\\nshould think that I was intruding into his affairs. And yet you\\r\\ncompromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business\\r\\nrelations between us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible alternative. I have been\\r\\ncommissioned to recover this immensely important paper. I must therefore\\r\\nask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant\\r\\nfrom her beautiful face. Her eyes glazed--she tottered--I thought that\\r\\nshe would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock,\\r\\nand a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression\\r\\nfrom her features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You--you insult me, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up the letter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe darted to the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The butler shall show you out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If you do, then all my earnest efforts to\\r\\navoid a scandal will be frustrated. Give up the letter and all will be\\r\\nset right. If you will work with me I can arrange everything. If you\\r\\nwork against me I must expose you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as\\r\\nif she would read his very soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had\\r\\nforborne to ring it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very manly thing, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. You say that you know\\r\\nsomething. What is it that you know?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pray sit down, madam. You will hurt yourself there if you fall. I will\\r\\nnot speak until you sit down. Thank you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I give you five minutes, Mr. Holmes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, of\\r\\nyour giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room\\r\\nlast night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the\\r\\nhiding-place under the carpet.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are mad, Mr. Holmes--you are mad!” she cried, at last.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. It was the face of a\\r\\nwoman cut out of a portrait.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have carried this because I thought it might be useful,” said he.\\r\\n“The policeman has recognized it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe gave a gasp, and her head dropped back in the chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, Lady Hilda. You have the letter. The matter may still be\\r\\nadjusted. I have no desire to bring trouble to you. My duty ends when\\r\\nI have returned the lost letter to your husband. Take my advice and be\\r\\nfrank with me. It is your only chance.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHer courage was admirable. Even now she would not own defeat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tell you again, Mr. Holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes rose from his chair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. I have done my best for you. I can see\\r\\nthat it is all in vain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe rang the bell. The butler entered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes glanced at his watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Still a quarter of an hour,” said he. “Very good, I shall wait.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda\\r\\nwas down on her knees at Holmes’s feet, her hands outstretched, her\\r\\nbeautiful face upturned and wet with her tears.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes! Spare me!” she pleaded, in a frenzy of\\r\\nsupplication. “For heaven’s sake, don’t tell him! I love him so! I would\\r\\nnot bring one shadow on his life, and this I know would break his noble\\r\\nheart.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes raised the lady. “I am thankful, madam, that you have come to\\r\\nyour senses even at this last moment! There is not an instant to lose.\\r\\nWhere is the letter?”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long\\r\\nblue envelope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here it is, Mr. Holmes. Would to heaven I had never seen it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How can we return it?” Holmes muttered. “Quick, quick, we must think of\\r\\nsome way! Where is the despatch-box?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Still in his bedroom.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What a stroke of luck! Quick, madam, bring it here!” A moment later she\\r\\nhad appeared with a red flat box in her hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you open it before? You have a duplicate key? Yes, of course\\r\\nyou have. Open it!”\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key. The box flew\\r\\nopen. It was stuffed with papers. Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep\\r\\ndown into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document.\\r\\nThe box was shut, locked, and returned to the bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now we are ready for him,” said Holmes. “We have still ten minutes.\\r\\nI am going far to screen you, Lady Hilda. In return you will spend\\r\\nthe time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary\\r\\naffair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,” cried the lady. “Oh, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of\\r\\nsorrow! There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I\\r\\ndo, and yet if he knew how I have acted--how I have been compelled to\\r\\nact--he would never forgive me. For his own honour stands so high that\\r\\nhe could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes!\\r\\nMy happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quick, madam, the time grows short!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indiscreet letter written\\r\\nbefore my marriage--a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving\\r\\ngirl. I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. Had he\\r\\nread that letter his confidence would have been forever destroyed. It\\r\\nis years since I wrote it. I had thought that the whole matter was\\r\\nforgotten. Then at last I heard from this man, Lucas, that it had passed\\r\\ninto his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. I implored\\r\\nhis mercy. He said that he would return my letter if I would bring him a\\r\\ncertain document which he described in my husband’s despatch-box. He had\\r\\nsome spy in the office who had told him of its existence. He assured me\\r\\nthat no harm could come to my husband. Put yourself in my position, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes! What was I to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take your husband into your confidence.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not! On the one side seemed certain\\r\\nruin, on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband’s paper,\\r\\nstill in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences,\\r\\nwhile in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me. I\\r\\ndid it, Mr. Holmes! I took an impression of his key. This man, Lucas,\\r\\nfurnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-box, took the paper, and\\r\\nconveyed it to Godolphin Street.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What happened there, madam?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I tapped at the door as agreed. Lucas opened it. I followed him into\\r\\nhis room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone\\r\\nwith the man. I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered.\\r\\nOur business was soon done. He had my letter on his desk, I handed him\\r\\nthe document. He gave me the letter. At this instant there was a sound\\r\\nat the door. There were steps in the passage. Lucas quickly turned\\r\\nback the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and\\r\\ncovered it over.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What happened after that is like some fearful dream. I have a vision of\\r\\na dark, frantic face, of a woman’s voice, which screamed in French, ‘My\\r\\nwaiting is not in vain. At last, at last I have found you with her!’\\r\\nThere was a savage struggle. I saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife\\r\\ngleamed in hers. I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house,\\r\\nand only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result. That\\r\\nnight I was happy, for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the\\r\\nfuture would bring.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was the next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one\\r\\ntrouble for another. My husband’s anguish at the loss of his paper went\\r\\nto my heart. I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling\\r\\ndown at his feet and telling him what I had done. But that again would\\r\\nmean a confession of the past. I came to you that morning in order to\\r\\nunderstand the full enormity of my offence. From the instant that I\\r\\ngrasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back\\r\\nmy husband’s paper. It must still be where Lucas had placed it, for it\\r\\nwas concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. If it had not\\r\\nbeen for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was.\\r\\nHow was I to get into the room? For two days I watched the place, but\\r\\nthe door was never left open. Last night I made a last attempt. What I\\r\\ndid and how I succeeded, you have already learned. I brought the paper\\r\\nback with me, and thought of destroying it, since I could see no way of\\r\\nreturning it without confessing my guilt to my husband. Heavens, I hear\\r\\nhis step upon the stair!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe European Secretary burst excitedly into the room. “Any news, Mr.\\r\\nHolmes, any news?” he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have some hopes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, thank heaven!” His face became radiant. “The Prime Minister is\\r\\nlunching with me. May he share your hopes? He has nerves of steel, and\\r\\nyet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. Jacobs,\\r\\nwill you ask the Prime Minister to come up? As to you, dear, I fear that\\r\\nthis is a matter of politics. We will join you in a few minutes in the\\r\\ndining-room.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Prime Minister’s manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam\\r\\nof his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the\\r\\nexcitement of his young colleague.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand that you have something to report, Mr. Holmes?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Purely negative as yet,” my friend answered. “I have inquired at every\\r\\npoint where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger to be\\r\\napprehended.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But that is not enough, Mr. Holmes. We cannot live forever on such a\\r\\nvolcano. We must have something definite.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am in hopes of getting it. That is why I am here. The more I think of\\r\\nthe matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this\\r\\nhouse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If it had it would certainly have been public by now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not convinced that anyone did take it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then how could it leave the despatch-box?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch-box.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. You have my assurance that\\r\\nit left the box.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. It was not necessary.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may conceivably have overlooked it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Impossible, I say.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I am not convinced of it. I have known such things to happen. I\\r\\npresume there are other papers there. Well, it may have got mixed with\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was on the top.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, no, I had everything out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Surely it is easily decided, Hope,” said the Premier. “Let us have the\\r\\ndespatch-box brought in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Secretary rang the bell.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. This is a farcical waste of time,\\r\\nbut still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. Thank\\r\\nyou, Jacobs, put it here. I have always had the key on my watch-chain.\\r\\nHere are the papers, you see. Letter from Lord Merrow, report from Sir\\r\\nCharles Hardy, memorandum from Belgrade, note on the Russo-German grain\\r\\ntaxes, letter from Madrid, note from Lord Flowers----Good heavens! what\\r\\nis this? Lord Bellinger! Lord Bellinger!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, it is it--and the letter is intact. Hope, I congratulate you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank you! Thank you! What a weight from my heart. But this is\\r\\ninconceivable--impossible. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! How\\r\\ndid you know it was there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Because I knew it was nowhere else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot believe my eyes!” He ran wildly to the door. “Where is my\\r\\nwife? I must tell her that all is well. Hilda! Hilda!” we heard his\\r\\nvoice on the stairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come, sir,” said he. “There is more in this than meets the eye. How\\r\\ncame the letter back in the box?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We also have our diplomatic secrets,” said he and, picking up his hat,\\r\\nhe turned to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE END\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\r\\nby Arthur Conan Doyle\\r\\n\\r\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE RETURN OF SHERLOCK HOLMES ***\\r\\n\\r\\n***** This file should be named 108-0.txt or 108-0.zip *****\\r\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\r\\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/108/\\r\\n\\r\\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\\r\\nwill be renamed.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\\r\\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\\r\\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\\r\\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\ufeff\\r\\n\\r\\nA STUDY IN SCARLET.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\\r\\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\\r\\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\\r\\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\\r\\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\\r\\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\\r\\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\\r\\nwas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\\r\\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\\r\\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\\r\\nentered upon my new duties.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\\r\\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\\r\\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\\r\\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\\r\\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\\r\\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\\r\\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\\r\\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\\r\\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\\r\\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\\r\\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\\r\\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\\r\\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\\r\\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\\r\\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\\r\\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\\r\\ntroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\\r\\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\\r\\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\\r\\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\\r\\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\\r\\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\\r\\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\\r\\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\\r\\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\\r\\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\\r\\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\\r\\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\\r\\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\\r\\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\\r\\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\\r\\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\\r\\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\\r\\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\\r\\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\\r\\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\\r\\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\\r\\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\\r\\nwe started off together in a hansom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\\r\\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\\r\\n“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\\r\\nby the time that we reached our destination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\\r\\nmisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\\r\\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\\r\\nprice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\\r\\nto-day that has used that expression to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who was the first?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\\r\\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\\r\\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\\r\\nwere too much for his purse.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\\r\\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\\r\\nto being alone.”\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\\r\\ndon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\\r\\nfor him as a constant companion.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, what is there against him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\\r\\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\\r\\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\\r\\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\\r\\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\\r\\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\\r\\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\\r\\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\\r\\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\\r\\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\\r\\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\\r\\ncould I meet this friend of yours?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\\r\\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\\r\\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\\r\\nchannels.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\\r\\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\\r\\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\\r\\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\\r\\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\\r\\nresponsible.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\\r\\nseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\\r\\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\\r\\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh.\\r\\n“Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to\\r\\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of\\r\\nthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,\\r\\nbut simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea\\r\\nof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself\\r\\nwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and\\r\\nexact knowledge.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very right too.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\\r\\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\\r\\nrather a bizarre shape.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beating the subjects!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\\r\\nat it with my own eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And yet you say he is not a medical student?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we\\r\\nare, and you must form your own impressions about him.” As he spoke, we\\r\\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\\r\\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\\r\\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\\r\\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\\r\\nwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\\r\\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\\r\\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\\r\\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\\r\\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\\r\\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\\r\\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. “I’ve found it! I’ve\\r\\nfound it,” he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\\r\\ntest-tube in his hand. “I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\\r\\nby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.” Had he discovered a gold mine,\\r\\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” said Stamford, introducing us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How are you?” he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\\r\\nfor which I should hardly have given him credit. “You have been in\\r\\nAfghanistan, I perceive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How on earth did you know that?” I asked in astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” said he, chuckling to himself. “The question now is about\\r\\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\\r\\nmine?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,” I answered, “but\\r\\npractically----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\\r\\nDon’t you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\\r\\nover here now!” He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\\r\\ndrew me over to the table at which he had been working. “Let us have\\r\\nsome fresh blood,” he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\\r\\ndrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. “Now, I\\r\\nadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\\r\\nthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\\r\\nof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\\r\\nthat we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.” As he\\r\\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\\r\\nsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\\r\\ndull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\\r\\nof the glass jar.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha! ha!” he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\\r\\nchild with a new toy. “What do you think of that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seems to be a very delicate test,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\\r\\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\\r\\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\\r\\nto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\\r\\ninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\\r\\nago have paid the penalty of their crimes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed!” I murmured.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\\r\\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\\r\\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\\r\\nAre they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\\r\\nor what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\\r\\nand why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes’ test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\\r\\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\\r\\nimagination.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are to be congratulated,” I remarked, considerably surprised at his\\r\\nenthusiasm.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\\r\\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was\\r\\nMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,\\r\\nand Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it\\r\\nwould have been decisive.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,” said Stamford with a\\r\\nlaugh. “You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the ‘Police News\\r\\nof the Past.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very interesting reading it might be made, too,” remarked Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\\r\\n“I have to be careful,” he continued, turning to me with a smile, “for I\\r\\ndabble with poisons a good deal.” He held out his hand as he spoke, and\\r\\nI noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,\\r\\nand discoloured with strong acids.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We came here on business,” said Stamford, sitting down on a high\\r\\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with\\r\\nhis foot. “My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\\r\\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\\r\\nthat I had better bring you together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\\r\\nme. “I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,” he said, “which would\\r\\nsuit us down to the ground. You don’t mind the smell of strong tobacco,\\r\\nI hope?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I always smoke ‘ship’s’ myself,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\\r\\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“By no means.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\\r\\ntimes, and don’t open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\\r\\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I’ll soon be right. What\\r\\nhave you to confess now? It’s just as well for two fellows to know the\\r\\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI laughed at this cross-examination. “I keep a bull pup,” I said, “and\\r\\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\\r\\nof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\\r\\nwhen I’m well, but those are the principal ones at present.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?” he asked,\\r\\nanxiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well-played violin is a treat\\r\\nfor the gods--a badly-played one----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that’s all right,” he cried, with a merry laugh. “I think we may\\r\\nconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When shall we see them?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we’ll go together and settle\\r\\neverything,” he answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All right--noon exactly,” said I, shaking his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\\r\\nmy hotel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By the way,” I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, “how\\r\\nthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. “That’s just his little\\r\\npeculiarity,” he said. “A good many people have wanted to know how he\\r\\nfinds things out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh! a mystery is it?” I cried, rubbing my hands. “This is very piquant.\\r\\nI am much obliged to you for bringing us together. ‘The proper study of\\r\\nmankind is man,’ you know.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You must study him, then,” Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\\r\\n“You’ll find him a knotty problem, though. I’ll wager he learns more\\r\\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\\r\\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,\\r\\n[5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\\r\\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\\r\\nairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\\r\\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\\r\\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\\r\\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\\r\\nThat very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\\r\\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\\r\\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\\r\\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\\r\\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\\r\\nsurroundings.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\\r\\nin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\\r\\nup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\\r\\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\\r\\nlaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\\r\\nwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\\r\\nNothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\\r\\nnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\\r\\nlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\\r\\na muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\\r\\na dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\\r\\nof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\\r\\nand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\\r\\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\\r\\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\\r\\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\\r\\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\\r\\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\\r\\nand his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\\r\\nalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\\r\\nwhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\\r\\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\\r\\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\\r\\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\\r\\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\\r\\nto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\\r\\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\\r\\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\\r\\nMy health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\\r\\nexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\\r\\nbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\\r\\neagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\\r\\nspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\\r\\nconfirmed Stamford’s opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\\r\\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\\r\\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\\r\\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\\r\\nand within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\\r\\nand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\\r\\nwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\\r\\ndefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\\r\\nexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\\r\\nunless he has some very good reason for doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\\r\\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\\r\\nUpon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\\r\\nmight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\\r\\nwhen I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\\r\\nand of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human\\r\\nbeing in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth\\r\\ntravelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact\\r\\nthat I could hardly realize it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You appear to be astonished,” he said, smiling at my expression of\\r\\nsurprise. “Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To forget it!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You see,” he explained, “I consider that a man’s brain originally is\\r\\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\\r\\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\\r\\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\\r\\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that\\r\\nhe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman\\r\\nis very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will\\r\\nhave nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of\\r\\nthese he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It\\r\\nis a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can\\r\\ndistend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every\\r\\naddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is\\r\\nof the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing\\r\\nout the useful ones.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the Solar System!” I protested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What the deuce is it to me?” he interrupted impatiently; “you say\\r\\nthat we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\\r\\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\\r\\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\\r\\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\\r\\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\\r\\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\\r\\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\\r\\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\\r\\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\\r\\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran\\r\\nin this way--\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.\\r\\n\\r\\n  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\\r\\n  2.              Philosophy.--Nil.\\r\\n  3.              Astronomy.--Nil.\\r\\n  4.              Politics.--Feeble.\\r\\n  5.              Botany.--Variable.  Well up in belladonna,\\r\\n                              opium, and poisons generally.\\r\\n                              Knows nothing of practical gardening.\\r\\n  6.              Geology.--Practical, but limited.\\r\\n                               Tells at a glance different soils\\r\\n                               from each other.  After walks has\\r\\n                               shown me splashes upon his trousers,\\r\\n                               and told me by their colour and\\r\\n                               consistence in what part of London\\r\\n                               he had received them.\\r\\n  7.              Chemistry.--Profound.\\r\\n  8.              Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\\r\\n  9.              Sensational Literature.--Immense.  He appears\\r\\n                              to know every detail of every horror\\r\\n                              perpetrated in the century.\\r\\n  10. Plays the violin well.\\r\\n  11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\\r\\n  12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\\r\\n“If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\\r\\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,”\\r\\n I said to myself, “I may as well give up the attempt at once.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\\r\\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.\\r\\nThat he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because\\r\\nat my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn’s Lieder, and other\\r\\nfavourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any\\r\\nmusic or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of\\r\\nan evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle\\r\\nwhich was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and\\r\\nmelancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they\\r\\nreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided\\r\\nthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim\\r\\nor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\\r\\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them\\r\\nby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\\r\\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\\r\\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\\r\\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\\r\\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\\r\\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\\r\\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\\r\\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\\r\\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\\r\\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\\r\\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\\r\\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\\r\\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\\r\\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\\r\\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\\r\\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. “I have\\r\\nto use this room as a place of business,” he said, “and these people\\r\\nare my clients.” Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank\\r\\nquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to\\r\\nconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\\r\\nnot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\\r\\nthe subject of his own accord.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\\r\\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\\r\\nyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\\r\\nlate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\\r\\nthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\\r\\nintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\\r\\nand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\\r\\nsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\\r\\nheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted to\\r\\nshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\\r\\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\\r\\nremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\\r\\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\\r\\nand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\\r\\nof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts.\\r\\nDeceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\\r\\ntrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\\r\\nas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\\r\\nto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\\r\\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the\\r\\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\\r\\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\\r\\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\\r\\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\\r\\nby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\\r\\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\\r\\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\\r\\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\\r\\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\\r\\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\\r\\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\\r\\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look\\r\\nfor. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his\\r\\ntrouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his\\r\\nexpression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man’s calling\\r\\nis plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the\\r\\ncompetent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\\r\\ntable, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, this article,” I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\\r\\ndown to my breakfast. “I see that you have read it since you have marked\\r\\nit. I don’t deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\\r\\nis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\\r\\nneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\\r\\npractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\\r\\ncarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\\r\\nfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You would lose your money,” Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. “As for\\r\\nthe article I wrote it myself.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\\r\\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\\r\\nchimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\\r\\nupon them for my bread and cheese.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how?” I asked involuntarily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\\r\\nworld. I’m a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\\r\\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\\r\\nones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\\r\\nput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\\r\\nam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\\r\\ncrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\\r\\nmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\\r\\nends, it is odd if you can’t unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\\r\\nis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\\r\\nforgery case, and that was what brought him here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And these other people?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\\r\\nall people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\\r\\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\\r\\nthen I pocket my fee.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But do you mean to say,” I said, “that without leaving your room you\\r\\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\\r\\nhave seen every detail for themselves?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\\r\\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\\r\\nsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\\r\\nwhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\\r\\nThose rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\\r\\nscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is\\r\\nsecond nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\\r\\nfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You were told, no doubt.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\\r\\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\\r\\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.\\r\\nThere were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, ‘Here is a\\r\\ngentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly\\r\\nan army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is\\r\\ndark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are\\r\\nfair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says\\r\\nclearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and\\r\\nunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have\\r\\nseen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.’ The\\r\\nwhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\\r\\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is simple enough as you explain it,” I said, smiling. “You remind\\r\\nme of Edgar Allen Poe’s Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\\r\\nexist outside of stories.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. “No doubt you think that you are\\r\\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,” he observed. “Now, in my\\r\\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking\\r\\nin on his friends’ thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\\r\\nan hour’s silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some\\r\\nanalytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as\\r\\nPoe appeared to imagine.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you read Gaboriau’s works?” I asked. “Does Lecoq come up to your\\r\\nidea of a detective?”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. “Lecoq was a miserable bungler,”\\r\\n he said, in an angry voice; “he had only one thing to recommend him, and\\r\\nthat was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was\\r\\nhow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\\r\\nhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\\r\\ndetectives to teach them what to avoid.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\\r\\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\\r\\nlooking out into the busy street. “This fellow may be very clever,” I\\r\\nsaid to myself, “but he is certainly very conceited.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,” he said,\\r\\nquerulously. “What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\\r\\nwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\\r\\never lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\\r\\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\\r\\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\\r\\nwith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see\\r\\nthrough it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it\\r\\nbest to change the topic.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wonder what that fellow is looking for?” I asked, pointing to a\\r\\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\\r\\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had\\r\\na large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\\r\\nmessage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,” said Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brag and bounce!” thought I to myself. “He knows that I cannot verify\\r\\nhis guess.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\\r\\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\\r\\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\\r\\nascending the stair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,” he said, stepping into the room and handing\\r\\nmy friend the letter.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\\r\\nthought of this when he made that random shot. “May I ask, my lad,” I\\r\\nsaid, in the blandest voice, “what your trade may be?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Commissionaire, sir,” he said, gruffly. “Uniform away for repairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you were?” I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\\r\\ncompanion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\\r\\nsir.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\\r\\ngone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY [6]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\\r\\npractical nature of my companion’s theories. My respect for his powers\\r\\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\\r\\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\\r\\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have\\r\\nin taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\\r\\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\\r\\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How in the world did you deduce that?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Deduce what?” said he, petulantly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no time for trifles,” he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\\r\\n“Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps\\r\\nit is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a\\r\\nsergeant of Marines?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you\\r\\nwere asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\\r\\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\\r\\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\\r\\nfellow’s hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\\r\\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\\r\\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\\r\\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\\r\\nhis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\\r\\nhim--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Commonplace,” said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he\\r\\nwas pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. “I said just now that\\r\\nthere were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!” He\\r\\nthrew me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” I cried, as I cast my eye over it, “this is terrible!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It does seem to be a little out of the common,” he remarked, calmly.\\r\\n“Would you mind reading it to me aloud?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the letter which I read to him----\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\\r\\n\\r\\n“There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,\\r\\noff the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in\\r\\nthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something\\r\\nwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare\\r\\nof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and\\r\\nhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of ‘Enoch J. Drebber,\\r\\nCleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.’ There had been no robbery, nor is there any\\r\\nevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in\\r\\nthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to\\r\\nhow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.\\r\\nIf you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find\\r\\nme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.\\r\\nIf you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\\r\\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\\r\\nYours faithfully,\\r\\n\\r\\n“TOBIAS GREGSON.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,” my friend remarked;\\r\\n“he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\\r\\nenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives\\r\\ninto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\\r\\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\\r\\nupon the scent.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. “Surely there is\\r\\nnot a moment to be lost,” I cried, “shall I go and order you a cab?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’m not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\\r\\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,\\r\\nfor I can be spry enough at times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\\r\\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\\r\\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But he begs you to help him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\\r\\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\\r\\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\\r\\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\\r\\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Get your hat,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You wish me to come?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if you have nothing better to do.” A minute later we were both in\\r\\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\\r\\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\\r\\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\\r\\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\\r\\nan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\\r\\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,” I said at\\r\\nlast, interrupting Holmes’ musical disquisition.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No data yet,” he answered. “It is a capital mistake to theorize before\\r\\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will have your data soon,” I remarked, pointing with my finger;\\r\\n“this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\\r\\nmistaken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it is. Stop, driver, stop!” We were still a hundred yards or so from\\r\\nit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon\\r\\nfoot.\\r\\n\\r\\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was\\r\\none of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being\\r\\noccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant\\r\\nmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and\\r\\nthere a “To Let” card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared\\r\\npanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly\\r\\nplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed\\r\\nby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a\\r\\nmixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the\\r\\nrain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a\\r\\nthree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and\\r\\nagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by\\r\\na small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes\\r\\nin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\\r\\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\\r\\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\\r\\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\\r\\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\\r\\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\\r\\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\\r\\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\\r\\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation\\r\\nof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey\\r\\nsoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was\\r\\nunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\\r\\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his\\r\\nperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal\\r\\nwhich was hidden from me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\\r\\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\\r\\nwrung my companion’s hand with effusion. “It is indeed kind of you to\\r\\ncome,” he said, “I have had everything left untouched.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Except that!” my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. “If a herd\\r\\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\\r\\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\\r\\npermitted this.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have had so much to do inside the house,” the detective said\\r\\nevasively. “My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\\r\\nto look after this.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. “With two\\r\\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\\r\\nmuch for a third party to find out,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. “I think we have done\\r\\nall that can be done,” he answered; “it’s a queer case though, and I\\r\\nknew your taste for such things.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not come here in a cab?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor Lestrade?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then let us go and look at the room.” With which inconsequent remark he\\r\\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\\r\\nhis astonishment.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\\r\\nTwo doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\\r\\nhad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\\r\\ndining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\\r\\noccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\\r\\nat my heart which the presence of death inspires.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\\r\\nof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\\r\\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\\r\\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\\r\\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\\r\\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\\r\\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\\r\\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\\r\\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\\r\\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\\r\\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\\r\\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\\r\\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\\r\\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\\r\\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\\r\\nand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\\r\\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\\r\\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\\r\\ngrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\\r\\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\\r\\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\\r\\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\\r\\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\\r\\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\\r\\nit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\\r\\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\\r\\nLondon.\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\\r\\ngreeted my companion and myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This case will make a stir, sir,” he remarked. “It beats anything I\\r\\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is no clue?” said Gregson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“None at all,” chimed in Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\\r\\nintently. “You are sure that there is no wound?” he asked, pointing to\\r\\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Positive!” cried both detectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]\\r\\npresumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\\r\\nthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\\r\\nthe year ‘34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\\r\\nhas all been done before.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\\r\\nfeeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same\\r\\nfar-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was\\r\\nthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\\r\\nwith which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man’s lips,\\r\\nand then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has not been moved at all?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You can take him to the mortuary now,” he said. “There is nothing more\\r\\nto be learned.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\\r\\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\\r\\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\\r\\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s been a woman here,” he cried. “It’s a woman’s wedding-ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\\r\\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\\r\\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This complicates matters,” said Gregson. “Heaven knows, they were\\r\\ncomplicated enough before.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re sure it doesn’t simplify them?” observed Holmes. “There’s\\r\\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\\r\\npockets?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have it all here,” said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\\r\\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. “A gold watch, No. 97163, by\\r\\nBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\\r\\nwith masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog’s head, with rubies as eyes.\\r\\nRussian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,\\r\\ncorresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose\\r\\nmoney to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of\\r\\nBoccaccio’s ‘Decameron,’ with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\\r\\nfly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\\r\\nStangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“At what address?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\\r\\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\\r\\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to\\r\\nreturn to New York.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I did it at once, sir,” said Gregson. “I have had advertisements\\r\\nsent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\\r\\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have you sent to Cleveland?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We telegraphed this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How did you word your inquiries?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\\r\\nof any information which could help us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\\r\\nbe crucial?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I asked about Stangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears\\r\\nto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have said all I have to say,” said Gregson, in an offended voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\\r\\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\\r\\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\\r\\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mr. Gregson,” he said, “I have just made a discovery of the highest\\r\\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\\r\\ncareful examination of the walls.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe little man’s eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\\r\\na state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\\r\\ncolleague.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come here,” he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\\r\\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. “Now, stand\\r\\nthere!”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at that!” he said, triumphantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\\r\\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\\r\\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\\r\\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\\r\\n\\r\\n                         RACHE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of that?” cried the detective, with the air of a\\r\\nshowman exhibiting his show. “This was overlooked because it was in the\\r\\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\\r\\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\\r\\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\\r\\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\\r\\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\\r\\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\\r\\nthe wall.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?” asked Gregson in a\\r\\ndepreciatory voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\\r\\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\\r\\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\\r\\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It’s all very well for\\r\\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\\r\\nthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I really beg your pardon!” said my companion, who had ruffled the\\r\\nlittle man’s temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. “You\\r\\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\\r\\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\\r\\nparticipant in last night’s mystery. I have not had time to examine this\\r\\nroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\\r\\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\\r\\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\\r\\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\\r\\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\\r\\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\\r\\nof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\\r\\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\\r\\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\\r\\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\\r\\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\\r\\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\\r\\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\\r\\ntape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\\r\\nhe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\\r\\nand packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\\r\\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\\r\\nminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\\r\\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,” he\\r\\nremarked with a smile. “It’s a very bad definition, but it does apply to\\r\\ndetective work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur\\r\\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\\r\\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\\r\\nSherlock Holmes’ smallest actions were all directed towards some\\r\\ndefinite and practical end.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you think of it, sir?” they both asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\\r\\nto help you,” remarked my friend. “You are doing so well now that it\\r\\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.” There was a world of\\r\\nsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. “If you will let me know how your\\r\\ninvestigations go,” he continued, “I shall be happy to give you any help\\r\\nI can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found\\r\\nthe body. Can you give me his name and address?”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. “John Rance,” he said. “He is off\\r\\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a note of the address.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come along, Doctor,” he said; “we shall go and look him up. I’ll tell\\r\\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,” he continued, turning to\\r\\nthe two detectives. “There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\\r\\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\\r\\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\\r\\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\\r\\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\\r\\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\\r\\nfinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a\\r\\nfew indications, but they may assist you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If this man was murdered, how was it done?” asked the former.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Poison,” said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. “One other thing,\\r\\nLestrade,” he added, turning round at the door: “‘Rache,’ is the German\\r\\nfor ‘revenge;’ so don’t lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\\r\\nopen-mouthed behind him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIT was one o’clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\\r\\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\\r\\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing like first hand evidence,” he remarked; “as a matter\\r\\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\\r\\nwell learn all that is to be learned.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You amaze me, Holmes,” said I. “Surely you are not as sure as you\\r\\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s no room for a mistake,” he answered. “The very first thing\\r\\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\\r\\nits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\\r\\nfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\\r\\nhave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s\\r\\nhoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\\r\\nthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\\r\\nwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\\r\\nmorning--I have Gregson’s word for that--it follows that it must have\\r\\nbeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\\r\\nindividuals to the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That seems simple enough,” said I; “but how about the other man’s\\r\\nheight?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\\r\\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\\r\\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride\\r\\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\\r\\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\\r\\nhim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\\r\\nover six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And his age?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\\r\\neffort, he can’t be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\\r\\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\\r\\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\\r\\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\\r\\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\\r\\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,” I suggested.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The writing on the wall was done with a man’s forefinger dipped in\\r\\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\\r\\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man’s\\r\\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\\r\\nIt was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\\r\\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I\\r\\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\\r\\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar\\r\\nor of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\\r\\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And the florid face?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\\r\\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI passed my hand over my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked; “the\\r\\nmore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\\r\\nmen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\\r\\ncabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\\r\\nWhere did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\\r\\nsince robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above\\r\\nall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\\r\\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\\r\\nall these facts.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” he\\r\\nsaid. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\\r\\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply\\r\\na blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\\r\\nSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\\r\\nyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\\r\\nGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\\r\\nsay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\\r\\noverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\\r\\nchannel. I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\\r\\nknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\\r\\nand if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\\r\\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall never do that,” I answered; “you have brought detection as near\\r\\nan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\\r\\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive\\r\\nto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell you one other thing,” he said. “Patent leathers [10] and\\r\\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\\r\\ntogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\\r\\nWhen they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\\r\\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\\r\\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\\r\\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\\r\\nstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\\r\\ninto a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I’ve told you all I know myself\\r\\nnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working\\r\\nbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to\\r\\nHalle’s concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\\r\\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\\r\\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\\r\\n“That’s Audley Court in there,” he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\\r\\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. “You’ll find me here when you come\\r\\nback.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\\r\\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\\r\\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\\r\\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\\r\\nwas decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\\r\\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were\\r\\nshown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\\r\\nhis slumbers. “I made my report at the office,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\\r\\npensively. “We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\\r\\nlips,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,” the constable\\r\\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\\r\\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll tell it ye from the beginning,” he said. “My time is from ten at\\r\\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the ‘White\\r\\nHart’; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o’clock it\\r\\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\\r\\nbeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin’.\\r\\nPresently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\\r\\na look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\\r\\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\\r\\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin’ down, thinkin’\\r\\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\\r\\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\\r\\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\\r\\non account of him that owns them who won’t have the drains seen to,\\r\\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o’ typhoid\\r\\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\\r\\nthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\\r\\ndoor----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,” my companion\\r\\ninterrupted. “What did you do that for?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\\r\\namazement upon his features.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, that’s true, sir,” he said; “though how you come to know it,\\r\\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\\r\\nso lonesome, that I thought I’d be none the worse for some one with me.\\r\\nI ain’t afeared of anything on this side o’ the grave; but I thought\\r\\nthat maybe it was him that died o’ the typhoid inspecting the drains\\r\\nwhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o’ turn, and I walked back\\r\\nto the gate to see if I could see Murcher’s lantern, but there wasn’t no\\r\\nsign of him nor of anyone else.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was no one in the street?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a livin’ soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\\r\\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\\r\\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin’. There was a\\r\\ncandle flickerin’ on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\\r\\nsaw----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\\r\\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\\r\\nthe kitchen door, and then----”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\\r\\nhis eyes. “Where was you hid to see all that?” he cried. “It seems to me\\r\\nthat you knows a deal more than you should.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\\r\\n“Don’t get arresting me for the murder,” he said. “I am one of the\\r\\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\\r\\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?”\\r\\n\\r\\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\\r\\n“I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher\\r\\nand two more to the spot.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Was the street empty then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What do you mean?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constable’s features broadened into a grin. “I’ve seen many a drunk\\r\\nchap in my time,” he said, “but never anyone so cryin’ drunk as\\r\\nthat cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin’ up agin the\\r\\nrailings, and a-singin’ at the pitch o’ his lungs about Columbine’s\\r\\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn’t stand, far less\\r\\nhelp.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of a man was he?” asked Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. “He was\\r\\nan uncommon drunk sort o’ man,” he said. “He’d ha’ found hisself in the\\r\\nstation if we hadn’t been so took up.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“His face--his dress--didn’t you notice them?” Holmes broke in\\r\\nimpatiently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--me\\r\\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\\r\\npart muffled round----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do,” cried Holmes. “What became of him?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We’d enough to do without lookin’ after him,” the policeman said, in an\\r\\naggrieved voice. “I’ll wager he found his way home all right.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“How was he dressed?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A brown overcoat.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Had he a whip in his hand?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A whip--no.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He must have left it behind,” muttered my companion. “You didn’t happen\\r\\nto see or hear a cab after that?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s a half-sovereign for you,” my companion said, standing up and\\r\\ntaking his hat. “I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\\r\\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\\r\\nmight have gained your sergeant’s stripes last night. The man whom you\\r\\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\\r\\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you\\r\\nthat it is so. Come along, Doctor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\\r\\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The blundering fool,” Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\\r\\nlodgings. “Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\\r\\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\\r\\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\\r\\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\\r\\nof criminals.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\\r\\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\\r\\nshall have him, Doctor--I’ll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\\r\\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\\r\\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?\\r\\nWhy shouldn’t we use a little art jargon. There’s the scarlet thread of\\r\\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is\\r\\nto unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now\\r\\nfor lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing\\r\\nare splendid. What’s that little thing of Chopin’s she plays so\\r\\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\\r\\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOUR morning’s exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\\r\\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes’ departure for the concert, I\\r\\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours’ sleep.\\r\\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\\r\\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\\r\\nit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\\r\\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\\r\\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\\r\\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\\r\\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\\r\\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\\r\\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\\r\\ndepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s\\r\\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\\r\\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\\r\\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\\r\\nhad caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\\r\\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\\r\\nthickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the\\r\\nvictim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As\\r\\nlong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\\r\\nno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\\r\\nmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained\\r\\nall the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\\r\\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before\\r\\nhe appeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was magnificent,” he said, as he took his seat. “Do you remember\\r\\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\\r\\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\\r\\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\\r\\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\\r\\nwhen the world was in its childhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s rather a broad idea,” I remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“One’s ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\\r\\nNature,” he answered. “What’s the matter? You’re not looking quite\\r\\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To tell the truth, it has,” I said. “I ought to be more case-hardened\\r\\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\\r\\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\\r\\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\\r\\nseen the evening paper?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\\r\\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman’s wedding ring fell upon\\r\\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look at this advertisement,” he answered. “I had one sent to every\\r\\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\\r\\nwas the first announcement in the “Found” column. “In Brixton Road,\\r\\nthis morning,” it ran, “a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\\r\\nbetween the ‘White Hart’ Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\\r\\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Excuse my using your name,” he said. “If I used my own some of these\\r\\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is all right,” I answered. “But supposing anyone applies, I have\\r\\nno ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh yes, you have,” said he, handing me one. “This will do very well. It\\r\\nis almost a facsimile.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\\r\\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Would he not consider it as too dangerous?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\\r\\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\\r\\nring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber’s\\r\\nbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\\r\\ndiscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\\r\\npossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\\r\\nto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\\r\\nbeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\\r\\nman’s place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\\r\\nthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\\r\\nthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\\r\\nevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\\r\\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\\r\\nhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\\r\\nof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\\r\\ncome. You shall see him within an hour?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,\\r\\nand though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\\r\\nanything.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\\r\\nthe pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\\r\\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The plot thickens,” he said, as I entered; “I have just had an answer\\r\\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And that is?” I asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My fiddle would be the better for new strings,” he remarked. “Put your\\r\\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary\\r\\nway. Leave the rest to me. Don’t frighten him by looking at him too\\r\\nhard.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is eight o’clock now,” I said, glancing at my watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.\\r\\nThat will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a\\r\\nqueer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--‘De Jure inter\\r\\nGentes’--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles’\\r\\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\\r\\nvolume was struck off.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Who is the printer?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\\r\\nfaded ink, is written ‘Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.’ I wonder who William\\r\\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\\r\\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\\r\\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\\r\\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\\r\\nopened it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Does Dr. Watson live here?” asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\\r\\ncould not hear the servant’s reply, but the door closed, and some one\\r\\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\\r\\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\\r\\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\\r\\ntap at the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Come in,” I cried.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\\r\\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\\r\\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\\r\\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\\r\\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\\r\\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\\r\\nkeep my countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\\r\\nadvertisement. “It’s this as has brought me, good gentlemen,” she said,\\r\\ndropping another curtsey; “a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\\r\\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\\r\\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he’d say if\\r\\nhe come ‘ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he\\r\\nbeing short enough at the best o’ times, but more especially when he\\r\\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along\\r\\nwith----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is that her ring?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Lord be thanked!” cried the old woman; “Sally will be a glad woman\\r\\nthis night. That’s the ring.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And what may your address be?” I inquired, taking up a pencil.\\r\\n\\r\\n“13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,” said\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\\r\\nred-rimmed eyes. “The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,” she said.\\r\\n“Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And your name is----?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is Sawyer--her’s is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and\\r\\na smart, clean lad, too, as long as he’s at sea, and no steward in the\\r\\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what\\r\\nwith liquor shops----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,” I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\\r\\nfrom my companion; “it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\\r\\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone\\r\\npacked it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into\\r\\nhis room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and\\r\\na cravat. “I’ll follow her,” he said, hurriedly; “she must be an\\r\\naccomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.” The hall door had\\r\\nhardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.\\r\\nLooking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the\\r\\nother side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.\\r\\n“Either his whole theory is incorrect,” I thought to myself, “or else he\\r\\nwill be led now to the heart of the mystery.” There was no need for him\\r\\nto ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until\\r\\nI heard the result of his adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\\r\\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\\r\\nof Henri Murger’s “Vie de Bohème.” Ten o’clock passed, and I heard the\\r\\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the\\r\\nmore stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\\r\\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\\r\\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\\r\\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\\r\\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\\r\\nhearty laugh.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I wouldn’t have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,” he cried,\\r\\ndropping into his chair; “I have chaffed them so much that they would\\r\\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\\r\\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it then?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\\r\\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\\r\\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which\\r\\nwas passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but\\r\\nI need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to\\r\\nbe heard at the other side of the street, ‘Drive to 13, Duncan Street,\\r\\nHoundsditch,’ she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and\\r\\nhaving seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That’s an art\\r\\nwhich every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and\\r\\nnever drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off\\r\\nbefore we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,\\r\\nlounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw\\r\\nhim open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When\\r\\nI reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and\\r\\ngiving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I\\r\\nlistened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it\\r\\nwill be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13\\r\\nwe found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named\\r\\nKeswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever\\r\\nbeen heard of there.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You don’t mean to say,” I cried, in amazement, “that that tottering,\\r\\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\\r\\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Old woman be damned!” said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. “We were the old\\r\\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an\\r\\nactive one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\\r\\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\\r\\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\\r\\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\\r\\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\\r\\nand turn in.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I\\r\\nleft Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\\r\\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,\\r\\nand knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he\\r\\nhad set himself to unravel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE papers next day were full of the “Brixton Mystery,” as they termed\\r\\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\\r\\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\\r\\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\\r\\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\\r\\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\\r\\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\\r\\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\\r\\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\\r\\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,\\r\\nand been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,\\r\\naqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian\\r\\ntheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the\\r\\narticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer\\r\\nwatch over foreigners in England.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\\r\\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\\r\\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\\r\\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had\\r\\nbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\\r\\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\\r\\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\\r\\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the\\r\\n4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\\r\\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\\r\\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber’s body\\r\\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\\r\\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\\r\\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\\r\\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\\r\\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\\r\\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\\r\\nthrow light upon the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\\r\\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\\r\\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\\r\\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\\r\\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\\r\\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\\r\\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\\r\\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\\r\\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\\r\\nof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to\\r\\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and\\r\\nthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\\r\\nto score.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That depends on how it turns out.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, bless you, it doesn’t matter in the least. If the man is caught, it\\r\\nwill be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in\\r\\nspite_ of their exertions. It’s heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever\\r\\nthey do, they will have followers. ‘Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot\\r\\nqui l’admire.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What on earth is this?” I cried, for at this moment there came the\\r\\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\\r\\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s the Baker Street division of the detective police force,” said my\\r\\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\\r\\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\\r\\neyes on.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Tention!” cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\\r\\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. “In\\r\\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\\r\\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, sir, we hain’t,” said one of the youths.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\\r\\nyour wages.” [13] He handed each of them a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,\\r\\nand we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There’s more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\\r\\nout of a dozen of the force,” Holmes remarked. “The mere sight of an\\r\\nofficial-looking person seals men’s lips. These youngsters, however, go\\r\\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\\r\\nthey want is organisation.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?” I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\\r\\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\\r\\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\\r\\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he\\r\\nis!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\\r\\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\\r\\nburst into our sitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My dear fellow,” he cried, wringing Holmes’ unresponsive hand,\\r\\n“congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.”\\r\\n\\r\\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion’s expressive face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that you are on the right track?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And his name is?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty’s navy,” cried\\r\\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,” he said. “We are anxious to\\r\\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t mind if I do,” the detective answered. “The tremendous\\r\\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn\\r\\nme out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon\\r\\nthe mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both\\r\\nbrain-workers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You do me too much honour,” said Holmes, gravely. “Let us hear how you\\r\\narrived at this most gratifying result.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\\r\\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\\r\\namusement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The fun of it is,” he cried, “that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\\r\\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\\r\\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\\r\\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\\r\\ntime.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how did you get your clue?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I’ll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\\r\\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend\\r\\nwith was the finding of this American’s antecedents. Some people would\\r\\nhave waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties\\r\\ncame forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson’s\\r\\nway of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Holmes; “by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had no idea that you noticed that,” he said. “Have you been there?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ha!” cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; “you should never neglect a\\r\\nchance, however small it may seem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To a great mind, nothing is little,” remarked Holmes, sententiously.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\\r\\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\\r\\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier’s Boarding\\r\\nEstablishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Smart--very smart!” murmured Sherlock Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I next called upon Madame Charpentier,” continued the detective.\\r\\n“I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\\r\\ntoo--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about\\r\\nthe eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn’t escape\\r\\nmy notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your\\r\\nnerves. ‘Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr.\\r\\nEnoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The mother nodded. She didn’t seem able to get out a word. The daughter\\r\\nburst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something\\r\\nof the matter.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘At what o’clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?’ I\\r\\nasked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘At eight o’clock,’ she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\\r\\nagitation. ‘His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\\r\\ntrains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. [14]\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘And was that the last which you saw of him?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“A terrible change came over the woman’s face as I asked the question.\\r\\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\\r\\ncould get out the single word ‘Yes’--and when it did come it was in a\\r\\nhusky unnatural tone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\\r\\nclear voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,’ she said. ‘Let us be\\r\\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘God forgive you!’ cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\\r\\nsinking back in her chair. ‘You have murdered your brother.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,’ the girl answered\\r\\nfirmly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You had best tell me all about it now,’ I said. ‘Half-confidences are\\r\\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘On your head be it, Alice!’ cried her mother; and then, turning to me,\\r\\n‘I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf\\r\\nof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this\\r\\nterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,\\r\\nthat in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be\\r\\ncompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his\\r\\nprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,’ I answered.\\r\\n‘Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,’ she said, and her\\r\\ndaughter withdrew. ‘Now, sir,’ she continued, ‘I had no intention of\\r\\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\\r\\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\\r\\nwithout omitting any particular.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It is your wisest course,’ said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,\\r\\nMr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a\\r\\n“Copenhagen” label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been\\r\\ntheir last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his\\r\\nemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his\\r\\nhabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became\\r\\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o’clock in the\\r\\nday he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the\\r\\nmaid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he\\r\\nspeedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke\\r\\nto her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent\\r\\nto understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and\\r\\nembraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him\\r\\nfor his unmanly conduct.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But why did you stand all this,’ I asked. ‘I suppose that you can get\\r\\nrid of your boarders when you wish.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ‘Would to God that\\r\\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,’ she said. ‘But\\r\\nit was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen\\r\\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in\\r\\nthe Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the\\r\\nbest. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on\\r\\naccount of it. That was the reason of his going.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Well?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\\r\\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\\r\\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the\\r\\ndoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\\r\\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\\r\\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\\r\\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\\r\\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.\\r\\nHe then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that\\r\\nshe should fly with him. “You are of age,” he said, “and there is no law\\r\\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\\r\\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\\r\\nprincess.” Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,\\r\\nbut he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the\\r\\ndoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.\\r\\nWhat happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds\\r\\nof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up\\r\\nI saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.\\r\\n“I don’t think that fine fellow will trouble us again,” he said. “I will\\r\\njust go after him and see what he does with himself.” With those words\\r\\nhe took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we\\r\\nheard of Mr. Drebber’s mysterious death.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier’s lips with many gasps and\\r\\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I\\r\\nmade shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should\\r\\nbe no possibility of a mistake.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s quite exciting,” said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. “What happened\\r\\nnext?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“When Mrs. Charpentier paused,” the detective continued, “I saw that the\\r\\nwhole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which\\r\\nI always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son\\r\\nreturned.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Not know?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘After you went to bed?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘When did you go to bed?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘About eleven.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘So your son was gone at least two hours?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Possibly four or five?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Yes.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What was he doing during that time?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I do not know,’ she answered, turning white to her very lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found\\r\\nout where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\\r\\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\\r\\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, ‘I suppose you\\r\\nare arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\\r\\nDrebber,’ he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\\r\\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very,” said Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\\r\\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is your theory, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.\\r\\nWhen there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of\\r\\nwhich Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,\\r\\nperhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so\\r\\nwet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim\\r\\ninto the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing\\r\\non the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the\\r\\npolice on to the wrong scent.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well done!” said Holmes in an encouraging voice. “Really, Gregson, you\\r\\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,” the detective\\r\\nanswered proudly. “The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\\r\\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\\r\\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\\r\\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\\r\\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\\r\\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to\\r\\nthink of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid\\r\\nhe won’t make much of [15] Why, by Jove, here’s the very man himself!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\\r\\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\\r\\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\\r\\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\\r\\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting\\r\\nwith Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\\r\\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\\r\\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. “This is a most\\r\\nextraordinary case,” he said at last--“a most incomprehensible affair.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!” cried Gregson, triumphantly. “I\\r\\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\\r\\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,” said Lestrade gravely, “was\\r\\nmurdered at Halliday’s Private Hotel about six o’clock this morning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\\r\\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\\r\\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\\r\\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his\\r\\nbrows drawn down over his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Stangerson too!” he muttered. “The plot thickens.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was quite thick enough before,” grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\\r\\n“I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?” stammered\\r\\nGregson.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have just come from his room,” said Lestrade. “I was the first to\\r\\ndiscover what had occurred.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have been hearing Gregson’s view of the matter,” Holmes observed.\\r\\n“Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no objection,” Lestrade answered, seating himself. “I freely\\r\\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in\\r\\nthe death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\\r\\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\\r\\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\\r\\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the\\r\\nmorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which\\r\\nconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between\\r\\n8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.\\r\\nI telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning\\r\\nthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling\\r\\nupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You\\r\\nsee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,\\r\\nthe natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the\\r\\nvicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,”\\r\\n remarked Holmes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\\r\\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\\r\\nat eight o’clock I reached Halliday’s Private Hotel, in Little George\\r\\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\\r\\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,’ they said. ‘He\\r\\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Where is he now?’ I asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘I will go up and see him at once,’ I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\\r\\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\\r\\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\\r\\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to\\r\\ngo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in\\r\\nspite of my twenty years’ experience. From under the door there curled\\r\\na little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and\\r\\nformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,\\r\\nwhich brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door\\r\\nwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it\\r\\nin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled\\r\\nup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\\r\\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned\\r\\nhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman\\r\\nwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause\\r\\nof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\\r\\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\\r\\nsuppose was above the murdered man?”\\r\\n\\r\\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\\r\\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was it,” said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\\r\\nsilent for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\\r\\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\\r\\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\\r\\ntingled as I thought of it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The man was seen,” continued Lestrade. “A milk boy, passing on his way\\r\\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\\r\\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\\r\\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\\r\\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\\r\\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\\r\\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\\r\\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him\\r\\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish\\r\\nface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\\r\\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained\\r\\nwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the\\r\\nsheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\\r\\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\\r\\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\\r\\nmurderer?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber’s purse in his pocket, but it seems\\r\\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\\r\\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\\r\\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\\r\\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man’s pocket, except a single\\r\\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing\\r\\nthe words, ‘J. H. is in Europe.’ There was no name appended to this\\r\\nmessage.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And there was nothing else?” Holmes asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nothing of any importance. The man’s novel, with which he had read\\r\\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\\r\\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\\r\\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The last link,” he cried, exultantly. “My case is complete.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have now in my hands,” my companion said, confidently, “all the\\r\\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\\r\\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\\r\\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\\r\\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\\r\\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\\r\\nupon those pills?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have them,” said Lestrade, producing a small white box; “I took them\\r\\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of\\r\\nsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these\\r\\npills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give them here,” said Holmes. “Now, Doctor,” turning to me, “are those\\r\\nordinary pills?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\\r\\nround, and almost transparent against the light. “From their lightness\\r\\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,” I\\r\\nremarked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Precisely so,” answered Holmes. “Now would you mind going down and\\r\\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,\\r\\nand which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It’s laboured\\r\\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\\r\\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\\r\\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\\r\\nrug.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will now cut one of these pills in two,” said Holmes, and drawing his\\r\\npenknife he suited the action to the word. “One half we return into the\\r\\nbox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,\\r\\nin which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the\\r\\nDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This may be very interesting,” said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\\r\\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, “I cannot see, however,\\r\\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\\r\\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\\r\\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\\r\\nit up readily enough.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\\r\\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes’ earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\\r\\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\\r\\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\\r\\nupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently\\r\\nneither the better nor the worse for its draught.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\\r\\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\\r\\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\\r\\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great\\r\\nwas his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\\r\\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which\\r\\nhe had met.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It can’t be a coincidence,” he cried, at last springing from his chair\\r\\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; “it is impossible that it should\\r\\nbe a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of\\r\\nDrebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they\\r\\nare inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot\\r\\nhave been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the\\r\\nworse. Ah, I have it! I have it!” With a perfect shriek of delight he\\r\\nrushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,\\r\\nand presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature’s tongue\\r\\nseemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive\\r\\nshiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been\\r\\nstruck by lightning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\\r\\nforehead. “I should have more faith,” he said; “I ought to know by\\r\\nthis time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\\r\\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\\r\\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\\r\\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\\r\\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\\r\\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\\r\\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\\r\\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\\r\\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\\r\\n\\r\\n“All this seems strange to you,” continued Holmes, “because you failed\\r\\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\\r\\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\\r\\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\\r\\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\\r\\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\\r\\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\\r\\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\\r\\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\\r\\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\\r\\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\\r\\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of\\r\\nthose _outré_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered\\r\\nit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\\r\\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\\r\\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. “Look here, Mr. Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes,” he said, “we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\\r\\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\\r\\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\\r\\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\\r\\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\\r\\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\\r\\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\\r\\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\\r\\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\\r\\nman who did it?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,” remarked Lestrade.\\r\\n“We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\\r\\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\\r\\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Any delay in arresting the assassin,” I observed, “might give him time\\r\\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\\r\\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\\r\\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There will be no more murders,” he said at last, stopping abruptly and\\r\\nfacing us. “You can put that consideration out of the question. You have\\r\\nasked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of\\r\\nhis name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying\\r\\nour hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes\\r\\nof managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which\\r\\nneeds delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal\\r\\nwith, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who\\r\\nis as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone\\r\\ncan have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the\\r\\nslightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant\\r\\namong the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning\\r\\nto hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these\\r\\nmen to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I\\r\\nhave not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all\\r\\nthe blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present\\r\\nI am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you\\r\\nwithout endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\\r\\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\\r\\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other’s beady eyes\\r\\nglistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to\\r\\nspeak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman\\r\\nof the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and\\r\\nunsavoury person.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Please, sir,” he said, touching his forelock, “I have the cab\\r\\ndownstairs.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good boy,” said Holmes, blandly. “Why don’t you introduce this pattern\\r\\nat Scotland Yard?” he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\\r\\na drawer. “See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\\r\\ninstant.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The old pattern is good enough,” remarked Lestrade, “if we can only\\r\\nfind the man to put them on.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Very good, very good,” said Holmes, smiling. “The cabman may as well\\r\\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\\r\\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\\r\\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\\r\\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,” he said, kneeling over\\r\\nhis task, and never turning his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\\r\\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\\r\\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gentlemen,” he cried, with flashing eyes, “let me introduce you to Mr.\\r\\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\\r\\nto realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes’\\r\\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman’s\\r\\ndazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\\r\\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\\r\\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\\r\\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes’s grasp, and hurled\\r\\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\\r\\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\\r\\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then\\r\\ncommenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that\\r\\nthe four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the\\r\\nconvulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands\\r\\nwere terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of\\r\\nblood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\\r\\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\\r\\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\\r\\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\\r\\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and\\r\\npanting.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have his cab,” said Sherlock Holmes. “It will serve to take him to\\r\\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,” he continued, with a pleasant smile,\\r\\n“we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to\\r\\nput any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I\\r\\nwill refuse to answer them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPART II. _The Country of the Saints._\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\\r\\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\\r\\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\\r\\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\\r\\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\\r\\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\\r\\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\\r\\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are\\r\\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\\r\\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\\r\\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\\r\\nor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\\r\\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\\r\\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\\r\\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\\r\\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\\r\\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These\\r\\nare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\\r\\nthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\\r\\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\\r\\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\\r\\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\\r\\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\\r\\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\\r\\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\\r\\ngrey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\\r\\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\\r\\nsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\\r\\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\\r\\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\\r\\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\\r\\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\\r\\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\\r\\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\\r\\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\\r\\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\\r\\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those\\r\\nwho had fallen by the wayside.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\\r\\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\\r\\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.\\r\\nAn observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer\\r\\nto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown\\r\\nparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his\\r\\nlong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his\\r\\neyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while\\r\\nthe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a\\r\\nskeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet\\r\\nhis tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry\\r\\nand vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,\\r\\nwhich hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\\r\\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was\\r\\ndying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\\r\\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great\\r\\nsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage\\r\\nmountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\\r\\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\\r\\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\\r\\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\\r\\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. “Why\\r\\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,” he muttered,\\r\\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,\\r\\nand also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried\\r\\nslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for\\r\\nhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some\\r\\nlittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little\\r\\nmoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very\\r\\nbright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve hurt me!” said a childish voice reproachfully.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Have I though,” the man answered penitently, “I didn’t go for to do\\r\\nit.” As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\\r\\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\\r\\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother’s care. The\\r\\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\\r\\nhad suffered less than her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“How is it now?” he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\\r\\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Kiss it and make it well,” she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\\r\\n[19] the injured part up to him. “That’s what mother used to do. Where’s\\r\\nmother?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Mother’s gone. I guess you’ll see her before long.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gone, eh!” said the little girl. “Funny, she didn’t say good-bye; she\\r\\n‘most always did if she was just goin’ over to Auntie’s for tea, and now\\r\\nshe’s been away three days. Say, it’s awful dry, ain’t it? Ain’t there\\r\\nno water, nor nothing to eat?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, there ain’t nothing, dearie. You’ll just need to be patient awhile,\\r\\nand then you’ll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and\\r\\nthen you’ll feel bullier. It ain’t easy to talk when your lips is like\\r\\nleather, but I guess I’d best let you know how the cards lie. What’s\\r\\nthat you’ve got?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pretty things! fine things!” cried the little girl enthusiastically,\\r\\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. “When we goes back to home\\r\\nI’ll give them to brother Bob.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ll see prettier things than them soon,” said the man confidently.\\r\\n“You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when\\r\\nwe left the river?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, we reckoned we’d strike another river soon, d’ye see. But there\\r\\nwas somethin’ wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin’, and it didn’t\\r\\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\\r\\nand--and----”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you couldn’t wash yourself,” interrupted his companion gravely,\\r\\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\\r\\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\\r\\nyour mother.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then mother’s a deader too,” cried the little girl dropping her face in\\r\\nher pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\\r\\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\\r\\nwe tramped it together. It don’t seem as though we’ve improved matters.\\r\\nThere’s an almighty small chance for us now!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you mean that we are going to die too?” asked the child, checking\\r\\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guess that’s about the size of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you say so before?” she said, laughing gleefully. “You gave\\r\\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we’ll be with\\r\\nmother again.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, you will, dearie.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And you too. I’ll tell her how awful good you’ve been. I’ll bet she\\r\\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\\r\\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\\r\\nfond of. How long will it be first?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know--not very long.” The man’s eyes were fixed upon the\\r\\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\\r\\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did\\r\\nthey approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown\\r\\nbirds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then\\r\\nsettled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the\\r\\nvultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Cocks and hens,” cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\\r\\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. “Say, did\\r\\nGod make this country?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“In course He did,” said her companion, rather startled by this\\r\\nunexpected question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,” the\\r\\nlittle girl continued. “I guess somebody else made the country in these\\r\\nparts. It’s not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\\r\\ntrees.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What would ye think of offering up prayer?” the man asked diffidently.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It ain’t night yet,” she answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It don’t matter. It ain’t quite regular, but He won’t mind that, you\\r\\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\\r\\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you say some yourself?” the child asked, with wondering eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I disremember them,” he answered. “I hain’t said none since I was half\\r\\nthe height o’ that gun. I guess it’s never too late. You say them out,\\r\\nand I’ll stand by and come in on the choruses.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then you’ll need to kneel down, and me too,” she said, laying the shawl\\r\\nout for that purpose. “You’ve got to put your hands up like this. It\\r\\nmakes you feel kind o’ good.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\\r\\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little\\r\\nprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,\\r\\nand his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless\\r\\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were\\r\\nface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other\\r\\ndeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The\\r\\nprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder\\r\\nuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her\\r\\nprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved\\r\\nto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\\r\\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\\r\\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\\r\\nman’s grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,\\r\\nand both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\\r\\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\\r\\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\\r\\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually\\r\\ngrowing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.\\r\\nThis cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it\\r\\ncould only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more\\r\\nfertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one\\r\\nof those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was\\r\\napproaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As\\r\\nthe whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two\\r\\ncastaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the\\r\\nfigures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the\\r\\napparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for\\r\\nthe West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base\\r\\nof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right\\r\\nacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons\\r\\nand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who\\r\\nstaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the\\r\\nwaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently\\r\\nno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\\r\\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\\r\\ncountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\\r\\nrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels\\r\\nand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\\r\\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\\r\\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching\\r\\nthe base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among\\r\\nthemselves.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The wells are to the right, my brothers,” said one, a hard-lipped,\\r\\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,”\\r\\n said another.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Fear not for water,” cried a third. “He who could draw it from the\\r\\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Amen! Amen!” responded the whole party.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\\r\\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\\r\\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\\r\\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\\r\\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\\r\\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\\r\\n‘Redskins’ was on every lip.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There can’t be any number of Injuns here,” said the elderly man who\\r\\nappeared to be in command. “We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no\\r\\nother tribes until we cross the great mountains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,” asked one of the band.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And I,” “and I,” cried a dozen voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave your horses below and we will await you here,” the Elder\\r\\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\\r\\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\\r\\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\\r\\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.\\r\\nThe watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\\r\\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had\\r\\nfirst given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him\\r\\nthrow up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining\\r\\nhim they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their\\r\\neyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\\r\\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\\r\\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid\\r\\nface and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him\\r\\nlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown\\r\\nsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his\\r\\nvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of\\r\\nsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile\\r\\nfeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and\\r\\nneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long\\r\\nshrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this\\r\\nstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of\\r\\nthe new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped\\r\\nsullenly away.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20]\\r\\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon\\r\\nthe plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and\\r\\nwhich was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His\\r\\nface assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his\\r\\nboney hand over his eyes. “This is what they call delirium, I guess,”\\r\\n he muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of\\r\\nhis coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering\\r\\nquestioning gaze of childhood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that\\r\\ntheir appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl,\\r\\nand hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt\\r\\ncompanion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\\r\\n\\r\\n“My name is John Ferrier,” the wanderer explained; “me and that little\\r\\nun are all that’s left o’ twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o’\\r\\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Is she your child?” asked someone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I guess she is now,” the other cried, defiantly; “she’s mine ‘cause I\\r\\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She’s Lucy Ferrier from this\\r\\nday on. Who are you, though?” he continued, glancing with curiosity at\\r\\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; “there seems to be a powerful lot of\\r\\nye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nigh upon ten thousand,” said one of the young men; “we are the\\r\\npersecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I never heard tell on him,” said the wanderer. “He appears to have\\r\\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do not jest at that which is sacred,” said the other sternly. “We are\\r\\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters\\r\\non plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith\\r\\nat Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we\\r\\nhad founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent\\r\\nman and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. “I\\r\\nsee,” he said, “you are the Mormons.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We are the Mormons,” answered his companions with one voice.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\\r\\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\\r\\nby crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\\r\\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries\\r\\nof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\\r\\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\\r\\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by\\r\\na great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\\r\\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\\r\\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\\r\\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\\r\\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\\r\\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\\r\\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\\r\\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he\\r\\nturned to the two castaways.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If we take you with us,” he said, in solemn words, “it can only be as\\r\\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\\r\\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\\r\\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the\\r\\nwhole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Guess I’ll come with you on any terms,” said Ferrier, with such\\r\\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\\r\\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Take him, Brother Stangerson,” he said, “give him food and drink,\\r\\nand the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\\r\\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“On, on to Zion!” cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down\\r\\nthe long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a\\r\\ndull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking\\r\\nof wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan\\r\\nwas winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs\\r\\nhad been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already\\r\\nawaiting them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall remain here,” he said. “In a few days you will have recovered\\r\\nfrom your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you\\r\\nare of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with\\r\\nthe voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\\r\\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the\\r\\nshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains\\r\\nthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.\\r\\nThe savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and\\r\\ndisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all\\r\\nbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the\\r\\naccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.\\r\\nThere was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer\\r\\nwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath\\r\\nthem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\\r\\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\\r\\nevermore.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\\r\\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future\\r\\ncity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in\\r\\nproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put\\r\\nto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and\\r\\nsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining\\r\\nand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole\\r\\ncountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange\\r\\nsettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the\\r\\ncentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of\\r\\ndawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\\r\\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\\r\\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\\r\\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\\r\\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\\r\\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson’s waggon, a retreat which\\r\\nshe shared with the Mormon’s three wives and with his son, a headstrong\\r\\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,\\r\\nfrom the shock caused by her mother’s death, she soon became a pet\\r\\nwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving\\r\\ncanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his\\r\\nprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable\\r\\nhunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that\\r\\nwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\\r\\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land\\r\\nas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of\\r\\nStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\\r\\nElders.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\\r\\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\\r\\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\\r\\nkeen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\\r\\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\\r\\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to\\r\\nhim prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\\r\\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve\\r\\nthere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could\\r\\ncompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\\r\\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities\\r\\nof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him\\r\\nto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He\\r\\nnever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by\\r\\nresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some\\r\\nwho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\\r\\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,\\r\\nagain, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who\\r\\nhad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,\\r\\nFerrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed\\r\\nto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\\r\\northodox and straight-walking man.\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\\r\\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\\r\\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\\r\\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\\r\\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\\r\\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier’s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\\r\\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\\r\\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father’s mustang,\\r\\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.\\r\\nSo the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father\\r\\nthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\\r\\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\\r\\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\\r\\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\\r\\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\\r\\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\\r\\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\\r\\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember\\r\\nthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the\\r\\ncase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart\\r\\nfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\\r\\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and\\r\\nin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high\\r\\nroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\\r\\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland\\r\\nRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of\\r\\nsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains\\r\\nof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable\\r\\njourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the\\r\\nskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair\\r\\nface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out\\r\\nbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was\\r\\ndashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\\r\\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\\r\\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\\r\\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\\r\\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced\\r\\nmaiden.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\\r\\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\\r\\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this\\r\\nobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely\\r\\nhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind\\r\\nher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of\\r\\nfierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with\\r\\ncattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of\\r\\nevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way\\r\\nthrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,\\r\\neither by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of\\r\\nthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\\r\\nits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\\r\\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\\r\\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\\r\\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could\\r\\ndo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death\\r\\nunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to\\r\\nsudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle\\r\\nto relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the\\r\\nstruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,\\r\\nbut for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At\\r\\nthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by\\r\\nthe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the\\r\\noutskirts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’re not hurt, I hope, miss,” said her preserver, respectfully.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. “I’m awful\\r\\nfrightened,” she said, naively; “whoever would have thought that Poncho\\r\\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God you kept your seat,” the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\\r\\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and\\r\\nclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his\\r\\nshoulders. “I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,” he remarked,\\r\\n“I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he\\r\\nremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he’s the same Ferrier, my\\r\\nfather and he were pretty thick.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t you better come and ask yourself?” she asked, demurely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\\r\\nsparkled with pleasure. “I’ll do so,” he said, “we’ve been in the\\r\\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\\r\\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,” she answered,\\r\\n“he’s awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he’d have never\\r\\ngot over it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Neither would I,” said her companion.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You! Well, I don’t see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\\r\\nYou ain’t even a friend of ours.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe young hunter’s dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\\r\\nFerrier laughed aloud.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There, I didn’t mean that,” she said; “of course, you are a friend now.\\r\\nYou must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won’t trust\\r\\nme with his business any more. Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\\r\\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\\r\\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\\r\\ndust.\\r\\n\\r\\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\\r\\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\\r\\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\\r\\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen\\r\\nas any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn\\r\\nhis thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl,\\r\\nas frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic,\\r\\nuntamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight,\\r\\nhe realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver\\r\\nspeculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to\\r\\nhim as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in\\r\\nhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the\\r\\nwild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He\\r\\nhad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in\\r\\nhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\\r\\nperseverance could render him successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until\\r\\nhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\\r\\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\\r\\nthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\\r\\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\\r\\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\\r\\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\\r\\nin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\\r\\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be\\r\\nhad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\\r\\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On\\r\\nsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,\\r\\nhappy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer\\r\\nher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\\r\\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\\r\\naffections.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\\r\\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\\r\\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am off, Lucy,” he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\\r\\ntenderly down into her face; “I won’t ask you to come with me now, but\\r\\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And when will that be?” she asked, blushing and laughing.\\r\\n\\r\\n“A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\\r\\ndarling. There’s no one who can stand between us.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how about father?” she asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\\r\\nright. I have no fear on that head.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there’s\\r\\nno more to be said,” she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\\r\\nbreast.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Thank God!” he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. “It is\\r\\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\\r\\nwaiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye. In two\\r\\nmonths you shall see me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\\r\\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\\r\\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at\\r\\nwhat he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until\\r\\nhe vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\\r\\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTHREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\\r\\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier’s heart was sore within him\\r\\nwhen he thought of the young man’s return, and of the impending loss of\\r\\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to\\r\\nthe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\\r\\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\\r\\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\\r\\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\\r\\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\\r\\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\\r\\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\\r\\nthe Land of the Saints.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\\r\\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\\r\\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\\r\\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\\r\\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most\\r\\nterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\\r\\nVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\\r\\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\\r\\nthe State of Utah.\\r\\n\\r\\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made\\r\\nthis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\\r\\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\\r\\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\\r\\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\\r\\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the\\r\\nhands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed\\r\\nby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\\r\\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men\\r\\nwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\\r\\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\\r\\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\\r\\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\\r\\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\\r\\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\\r\\nrumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and\\r\\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\\r\\nappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and\\r\\nbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\\r\\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\\r\\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\\r\\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\\r\\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\\r\\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\\r\\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\\r\\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\\r\\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\\r\\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\\r\\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\\r\\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\\r\\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\\r\\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\\r\\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\\r\\nnearest his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\\r\\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\\r\\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\\r\\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham\\r\\nYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded\\r\\nhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The\\r\\nlatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with\\r\\na stern face into the sitting-room.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Brother Ferrier,” he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\\r\\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, “the true believers have been\\r\\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\\r\\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\\r\\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\\r\\nprotection. Is not this so?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is so,” answered John Ferrier.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\\r\\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\\r\\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have\\r\\nneglected.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And how have I neglected it?” asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\\r\\nexpostulation. “Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended\\r\\nat the Temple? Have I not----?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are your wives?” asked Young, looking round him. “Call them in,\\r\\nthat I may greet them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is true that I have not married,” Ferrier answered. “But women\\r\\nwere few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\\r\\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,” said the leader\\r\\nof the Mormons. “She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\\r\\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that\\r\\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\\r\\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\\r\\n‘Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if\\r\\nshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.’ This being so, it is\\r\\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\\r\\ndaughter to violate it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\\r\\nriding-whip.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\\r\\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\\r\\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\\r\\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also\\r\\nbe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\\r\\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\\r\\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\\r\\nyou to that?”\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You will give us time,” he said at last. “My daughter is very\\r\\nyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She shall have a month to choose,” said Young, rising from his seat.\\r\\n“At the end of that time she shall give her answer.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\\r\\nflashing eyes. “It were better for you, John Ferrier,” he thundered,\\r\\n“that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\\r\\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\\r\\nthe Holy Four!”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\\r\\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\\r\\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\\r\\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\\r\\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I could not help it,” she said, in answer to his look. “His voice rang\\r\\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you scare yourself,” he answered, drawing her to him, and passing\\r\\nhis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. “We’ll fix it\\r\\nup somehow or another. You don’t find your fancy kind o’ lessening for\\r\\nthis chap, do you?”\\r\\n\\r\\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“No; of course not. I shouldn’t care to hear you say you did. He’s a\\r\\nlikely lad, and he’s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in\\r\\nspite o’ all their praying and preaching. There’s a party starting for\\r\\nNevada to-morrow, and I’ll manage to send him a message letting him know\\r\\nthe hole we are in. If I know anything o’ that young man, he’ll be back\\r\\nhere with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.”\\r\\n\\r\\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father’s description.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\\r\\nI am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about\\r\\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\\r\\nthem.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But we haven’t opposed him yet,” her father answered. “It will be time\\r\\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\\r\\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Leave Utah!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s about the size of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But the farm?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\\r\\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn’t the first time I have thought of doing it. I\\r\\ndon’t care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\\r\\ndarned prophet. I’m a free-born American, and it’s all new to me. Guess\\r\\nI’m too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\\r\\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite\\r\\ndirection.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But they won’t let us leave,” his daughter objected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wait till Jefferson comes, and we’ll soon manage that. In the meantime,\\r\\ndon’t you fret yourself, my dearie, and don’t get your eyes swelled up,\\r\\nelse he’ll be walking into me when he sees you. There’s nothing to be\\r\\nafeared about, and there’s no danger at all.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\\r\\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\\r\\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\\r\\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\\r\\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\\r\\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\\r\\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\\r\\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\\r\\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned\\r\\nhome with a lighter heart.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\\r\\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\\r\\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\\r\\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\\r\\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\\r\\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\\r\\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\\r\\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Maybe you don’t know us,” he said. “This here is the son of Elder\\r\\nDrebber, and I’m Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert\\r\\nwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true\\r\\nfold.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As He will all the nations in His own good time,” said the other in a\\r\\nnasal voice; “He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We have come,” continued Stangerson, “at the advice of our fathers to\\r\\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\\r\\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\\r\\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,” cried the other; “the question is not\\r\\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\\r\\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“But my prospects are better,” said the other, warmly. “When the\\r\\nLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\\r\\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It will be for the maiden to decide,” rejoined young Drebber, smirking\\r\\nat his own reflection in the glass. “We will leave it all to her\\r\\ndecision.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\\r\\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look here,” he said at last, striding up to them, “when my daughter\\r\\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don’t want to see your faces\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\\r\\ncompetition between them for the maiden’s hand was the highest of\\r\\nhonours both to her and her father.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There are two ways out of the room,” cried Ferrier; “there is the door,\\r\\nand there is the window. Which do you care to use?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\\r\\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\\r\\nold farmer followed them to the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,” he said,\\r\\nsardonically.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You shall smart for this!” Stangerson cried, white with rage. “You have\\r\\ndefied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end\\r\\nof your days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,” cried young Drebber; “He\\r\\nwill arise and smite you!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then I’ll start the smiting,” exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\\r\\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\\r\\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses’\\r\\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The young canting rascals!” he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\\r\\nhis forehead; “I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\\r\\nwife of either of them.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“And so should I, father,” she answered, with spirit; “but Jefferson\\r\\nwill soon be here.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we\\r\\ndo not know what their next move may be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\\r\\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\\r\\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\\r\\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\\r\\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\\r\\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\\r\\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\\r\\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\\r\\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\\r\\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but\\r\\nthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\\r\\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\\r\\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\\r\\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\\r\\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,\\r\\na small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\\r\\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--\\r\\n\\r\\n“Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\\r\\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\\r\\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\\r\\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\\r\\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\\r\\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\\r\\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\\r\\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\\r\\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\\r\\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\\r\\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\\r\\nthe number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\\r\\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\\r\\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had\\r\\nbeen painted upon the outside of his door.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\\r\\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\\r\\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\\r\\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\\r\\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\\r\\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\\r\\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\\r\\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\\r\\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look\\r\\nof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was\\r\\nfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\\r\\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\\r\\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\\r\\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\\r\\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\\r\\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\\r\\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\\r\\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\\r\\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\\r\\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\\r\\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\\r\\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\\r\\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter’s dishonour.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\\r\\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the\\r\\nfigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last\\r\\nof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and\\r\\nterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to\\r\\nbecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible\\r\\nnetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table\\r\\nand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,\\r\\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\\r\\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There\\r\\nwas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\\r\\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\\r\\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\\r\\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\\r\\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\\r\\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\\r\\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\\r\\nthrew the door open.\\r\\n\\r\\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\\r\\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\\r\\nfarmer’s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\\r\\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\\r\\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\\r\\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\\r\\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\\r\\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\\r\\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\\r\\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the\\r\\nhall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the\\r\\nhouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the\\r\\nastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson\\r\\nHope.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good God!” gasped John Ferrier. “How you scared me! Whatever made you\\r\\ncome in like that.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Give me food,” the other said, hoarsely. “I have had no time for bite\\r\\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.” He flung himself upon the [21] cold\\r\\nmeat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host’s\\r\\nsupper, and devoured it voraciously. “Does Lucy bear up well?” he asked,\\r\\nwhen he had satisfied his hunger.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes. She does not know the danger,” her father answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled\\r\\nmy way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they’re not quite sharp\\r\\nenough to catch a Washoe hunter.”\\r\\n\\r\\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had\\r\\na devoted ally. He seized the young man’s leathery hand and wrung it\\r\\ncordially. “You’re a man to be proud of,” he said. “There are not many\\r\\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You’ve hit it there, pard,” the young hunter answered. “I have a\\r\\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I’d think twice\\r\\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet’s nest. It’s Lucy that brings me\\r\\nhere, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o’ the\\r\\nHope family in Utah.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What are we to do?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\\r\\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money\\r\\nhave you?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson\\r\\nCity through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that\\r\\nthe servants do not sleep in the house.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\\r\\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\\r\\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\\r\\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\\r\\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\\r\\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\\r\\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\\r\\nmuch to be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We must make our start at once,” said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low\\r\\nbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,\\r\\nbut has steeled his heart to meet it. “The front and back entrances are\\r\\nwatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and\\r\\nacross the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the\\r\\nRavine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way\\r\\nthrough the mountains.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What if we are stopped,” asked Ferrier.\\r\\n\\r\\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\\r\\ntunic. “If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\\r\\nwith us,” he said with a sinister smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\\r\\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\\r\\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\\r\\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\\r\\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\\r\\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\\r\\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that\\r\\nthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\\r\\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\\r\\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\\r\\n\\r\\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\\r\\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few\\r\\nof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\\r\\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\\r\\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\\r\\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\\r\\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\\r\\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\\r\\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\\r\\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\\r\\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\\r\\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards\\r\\nof them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\\r\\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\\r\\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry\\r\\nagain, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“To-morrow at midnight,” said the first who appeared to be in authority.\\r\\n“When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is well,” returned the other. “Shall I tell Brother Drebber?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven to five!” repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\\r\\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\\r\\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\\r\\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his\\r\\ncompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top\\r\\nof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength\\r\\nappeared to fail her.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hurry on! hurry on!” he gasped from time to time. “We are through the\\r\\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!”\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they\\r\\nmeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\\r\\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\\r\\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\\r\\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\\r\\nbetween them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting them.\\r\\nWith unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great\\r\\nboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to\\r\\nthe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had\\r\\nbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon\\r\\none of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the\\r\\nother along the precipitous and dangerous path.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\\r\\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\\r\\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\\r\\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.\\r\\nOn the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance\\r\\nimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places\\r\\nthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised\\r\\nriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and\\r\\ndifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,\\r\\nfor every step increased the distance between them and the terrible\\r\\ndespotism from which they were flying.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\\r\\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\\r\\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\\r\\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\\r\\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\\r\\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of “Who goes\\r\\nthere?” rang through the silent ravine.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Travellers for Nevada,” said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\\r\\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at\\r\\nthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n“By whose permission?” he asked.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Holy Four,” answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him\\r\\nthat that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nine from seven,” cried the sentinel.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Seven from five,” returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\\r\\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pass, and the Lord go with you,” said the voice from above. Beyond his\\r\\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\\r\\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\\r\\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\\r\\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\\r\\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope’s\\r\\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\\r\\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\\r\\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\\r\\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other’s shoulders to the far horizon.\\r\\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\\r\\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a\\r\\ngust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely\\r\\nan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and\\r\\nboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,\\r\\na great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke\\r\\nthe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a\\r\\ngallop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\\r\\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\\r\\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\\r\\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\\r\\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their\\r\\nhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father\\r\\nwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. “They\\r\\nwill be upon our track by this time,” he said. “Everything depends upon\\r\\nour speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our\\r\\nlives.”\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\\r\\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\\r\\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\\r\\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\\r\\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours’ sleep. Before\\r\\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\\r\\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\\r\\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\\r\\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\\r\\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\\r\\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\\r\\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\\r\\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\\r\\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\\r\\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\\r\\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air\\r\\nwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,\\r\\nhe threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever\\r\\nchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the\\r\\nyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\\r\\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them\\r\\nfrom his view.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\\r\\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\\r\\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.\\r\\nAt last, after two or three hours’ fruitless search, he was thinking of\\r\\nturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight\\r\\nwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a\\r\\njutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a\\r\\ncreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a\\r\\npair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,\\r\\nprobably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;\\r\\nbut fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not\\r\\nperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and\\r\\ntook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang\\r\\ninto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and\\r\\nthen came crashing down into the valley beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\\r\\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\\r\\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was\\r\\nalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized\\r\\nthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far\\r\\npast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter\\r\\nto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found\\r\\nhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like\\r\\neach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.\\r\\nHe followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent\\r\\nwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\\r\\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night\\r\\nwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\\r\\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy\\r\\nmatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and\\r\\nthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed\\r\\ndown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,\\r\\nkeeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him\\r\\nnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food\\r\\nfor the remainder of their journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\\r\\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\\r\\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\\r\\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\\r\\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo\\r\\nas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.\\r\\nNone came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent\\r\\nravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again\\r\\nhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from\\r\\nthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless\\r\\ndread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\\r\\nprecious food in his agitation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\\r\\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\\r\\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same\\r\\ndead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\\r\\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\\r\\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\\r\\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\\r\\nhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\\r\\ntraces behind it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\\r\\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\\r\\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\\r\\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\\r\\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\\r\\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\\r\\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken\\r\\nthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\\r\\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\\r\\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\\r\\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made\\r\\nevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of\\r\\nthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly\\r\\nnot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a\\r\\nnewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a\\r\\nstick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft\\r\\nfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\\r\\n\\r\\n                        JOHN FERRIER,\\r\\n                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]\\r\\n                    Died August 4th, 1860.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\\r\\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\\r\\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\\r\\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\\r\\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder’s son. As the young\\r\\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\\r\\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his\\r\\nlast silent resting-place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\\r\\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\\r\\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\\r\\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which\\r\\nhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he\\r\\nstood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could\\r\\nassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought\\r\\nby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy\\r\\nshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white\\r\\nface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having\\r\\nstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a\\r\\nfew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\\r\\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\\r\\navenging angels.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\\r\\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among\\r\\nthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was\\r\\nalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Cañon,\\r\\nfrom which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could\\r\\nlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned\\r\\nupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\\r\\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that\\r\\nthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\\r\\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\\r\\nheard the clatter of horse’s hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards\\r\\nhim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\\r\\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted\\r\\nhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy\\r\\nFerrier’s fate had been.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am Jefferson Hope,” he said. “You remember me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was\\r\\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\\r\\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\\r\\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\\r\\nthe man’s surprise changed to consternation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You are mad to come here,” he cried. “It is as much as my own life is\\r\\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\\r\\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t fear them, or their warrant,” Hope said, earnestly. “You must\\r\\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\\r\\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\\r\\nGod’s sake, don’t refuse to answer me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” the Mormon asked uneasily. “Be quick. The very rocks have\\r\\nears and the trees eyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What has become of Lucy Ferrier?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\\r\\nhave no life left in you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mind me,” said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\\r\\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. “Married,\\r\\nyou say?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Married yesterday--that’s what those flags are for on the Endowment\\r\\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\\r\\nas to which was to have her. They’d both been in the party that followed\\r\\nthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the\\r\\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber’s party was\\r\\nthe stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won’t have\\r\\nher very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more\\r\\nlike a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, I am off,” said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\\r\\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\\r\\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Where are you going?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\\r\\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to\\r\\nthe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce\\r\\nand so dangerous as himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was\\r\\nthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\\r\\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,\\r\\nbut pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had\\r\\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier’s property, did not\\r\\naffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned\\r\\nover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the\\r\\nMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of\\r\\nthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,\\r\\nthe door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in\\r\\ntattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\\r\\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had\\r\\nonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he\\r\\npressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching\\r\\nup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. “She shall not be\\r\\nburied in that,” he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could\\r\\nbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\\r\\nwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe\\r\\nit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the\\r\\nundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been\\r\\na bride had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\\r\\na strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\\r\\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\\r\\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\\r\\nthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson’s\\r\\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\\r\\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\\r\\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\\r\\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\\r\\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\\r\\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\\r\\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\\r\\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\\r\\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\\r\\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\\r\\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter’s mind\\r\\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\\r\\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for\\r\\nany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\\r\\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\\r\\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\\r\\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what\\r\\nwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to\\r\\novertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy’s\\r\\ngame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\\r\\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his\\r\\nobject without privation.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\\r\\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\\r\\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of\\r\\nhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\\r\\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier’s grave. Disguised,\\r\\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless\\r\\nwhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to\\r\\nbe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\\r\\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\\r\\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\\r\\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\\r\\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\\r\\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour\\r\\nreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\\r\\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\\r\\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\\r\\nhowever, as to their whereabouts.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\\r\\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\\r\\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\\r\\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\\r\\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\\r\\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\\r\\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\\r\\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was\\r\\nbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\\r\\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\\r\\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\\r\\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\\r\\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in\\r\\nhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\\r\\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him\\r\\nthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of\\r\\nan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and\\r\\nnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at\\r\\nlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber’s house was\\r\\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\\r\\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\\r\\nfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\\r\\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\\r\\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\\r\\ncity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\\r\\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\\r\\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\\r\\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\\r\\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\\r\\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote\\r\\nthe old hunter’s own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson’s Journal,\\r\\nto which we are already under such obligations.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOUR prisoner’s furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\\r\\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\\r\\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\\r\\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. “I guess you’re going to take\\r\\nme to the police-station,” he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. “My cab’s at\\r\\nthe door. If you’ll loose my legs I’ll walk down to it. I’m not so light\\r\\nto lift as I used to be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\\r\\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\\r\\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles.\\r\\n[23] He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that\\r\\nthey were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\\r\\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\\r\\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\\r\\nas formidable as his personal strength.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If there’s a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you\\r\\nare the man for it,” he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\\r\\nfellow-lodger. “The way you kept on my trail was a caution.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You had better come with me,” said Holmes to the two detectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I can drive you,” said Lestrade.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\\r\\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\\r\\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\\r\\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and\\r\\nbrought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into\\r\\na small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner’s name\\r\\nand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The\\r\\nofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\\r\\nduties in a dull mechanical way. “The prisoner will be put before the\\r\\nmagistrates in the course of the week,” he said; “in the mean time, Mr.\\r\\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\\r\\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got a good deal to say,” our prisoner said slowly. “I want to tell\\r\\nyou gentlemen all about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Hadn’t you better reserve that for your trial?” asked the Inspector.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I may never be tried,” he answered. “You needn’t look startled. It\\r\\nisn’t suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?” He turned his fierce\\r\\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I am,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Then put your hand here,” he said, with a smile, motioning with his\\r\\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and\\r\\ncommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to\\r\\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful\\r\\nengine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull\\r\\nhumming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Why,” I cried, “you have an aortic aneurism!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s what they call it,” he said, placidly. “I went to a Doctor last\\r\\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days\\r\\npassed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure\\r\\nand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I’ve done my work now,\\r\\nand I don’t care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account\\r\\nof the business behind me. I don’t want to be remembered as a common\\r\\ncut-throat.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\\r\\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?” the former\\r\\nasked, [24]\\r\\n\\r\\n“Most certainly there is,” I answered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\\r\\ntake his statement,” said the Inspector. “You are at liberty, sir, to\\r\\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I’ll sit down, with your leave,” the prisoner said, suiting the action\\r\\nto the word. “This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\\r\\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I’m on the brink\\r\\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the\\r\\nabsolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began\\r\\nthe following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\\r\\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\\r\\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\\r\\naccess to Lestrade’s note-book, in which the prisoner’s words were taken\\r\\ndown exactly as they were uttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It don’t much matter to you why I hated these men,” he said; “it’s\\r\\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father\\r\\nand a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own\\r\\nlives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\\r\\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\\r\\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\\r\\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You’d have done the same, if\\r\\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\\r\\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\\r\\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\\r\\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\\r\\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried\\r\\nit about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\\r\\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\\r\\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\\r\\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\\r\\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\\r\\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found\\r\\nthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding\\r\\nare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner’s office,\\r\\nand soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the\\r\\nowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was\\r\\nseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job\\r\\nwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever\\r\\nwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\\r\\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I\\r\\ngot on pretty well.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;\\r\\nbut I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They\\r\\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the\\r\\nriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I\\r\\nhad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.\\r\\nI would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was\\r\\ndetermined that they should not escape me again.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\\r\\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\\r\\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\\r\\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late\\r\\nat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\\r\\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\\r\\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\\r\\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\\r\\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\\r\\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\\r\\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\\r\\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\\r\\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\\r\\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\\r\\nand leave my work undone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\\r\\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\\r\\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\\r\\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse\\r\\nand kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared\\r\\nthat they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they\\r\\ngot out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the\\r\\nplatform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer\\r\\nthat one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours.\\r\\nStangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased\\r\\nthan otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear\\r\\nevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little\\r\\nbusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\\r\\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded\\r\\nhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the\\r\\nmatter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch\\r\\nwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\\r\\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he\\r\\nmust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up\\r\\nas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last\\r\\ntrain he should rejoin him at Halliday’s Private Hotel; to which Drebber\\r\\nanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made\\r\\nhis way out of the station.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\\r\\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,\\r\\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\\r\\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in\\r\\nvengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes\\r\\nhim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by\\r\\nwhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me\\r\\nunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days\\r\\nbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in\\r\\nthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It\\r\\nwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had\\r\\ntaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\\r\\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could\\r\\nrely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house\\r\\nwas the difficult problem which I had now to solve.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\\r\\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\\r\\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\\r\\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\\r\\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.\\r\\nWe rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,\\r\\nto my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he\\r\\nhad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning\\r\\nthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\\r\\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of\\r\\nwater, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.”\\r\\n\\r\\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That’s better,” he said. “Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\\r\\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the\\r\\nhouse. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of\\r\\nwhom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen\\r\\nbefore. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to\\r\\nthe head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half\\r\\nacross the road. ‘You hound,’ he cried, shaking his stick at him; ‘I’ll\\r\\nteach you to insult an honest girl!’ He was so hot that I think he would\\r\\nhave thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away\\r\\ndown the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the\\r\\ncorner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. ‘Drive me\\r\\nto Halliday’s Private Hotel,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\\r\\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\\r\\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\\r\\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\\r\\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he\\r\\nsolved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and\\r\\nhe ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word\\r\\nthat I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and\\r\\nwhen he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own\\r\\nhands.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Don’t imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\\r\\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\\r\\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\\r\\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\\r\\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\\r\\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was\\r\\nlecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,\\r\\nas he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\\r\\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\\r\\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when\\r\\nthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly\\r\\ngood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and\\r\\neach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.\\r\\nI determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should\\r\\neach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\\r\\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than\\r\\nfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes\\r\\nabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\\r\\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so\\r\\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\\r\\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\\r\\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\\r\\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\\r\\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\\r\\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\\r\\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\\r\\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each\\r\\nside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\\r\\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\\r\\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, ‘It’s\\r\\ntime to get out,’ I said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘All right, cabby,’ said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\\r\\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\\r\\nI had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\\r\\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\\r\\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\\r\\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It’s infernally dark,’ said he, stamping about.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘We’ll soon have a light,’ I said, striking a match and putting it to\\r\\na wax candle which I had brought with me. ‘Now, Enoch Drebber,’ I\\r\\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, ‘who am\\r\\nI?’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\\r\\nsaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\\r\\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\\r\\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\\r\\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed\\r\\nloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I\\r\\nhad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘You dog!’ I said; ‘I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\\r\\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings\\r\\nhave come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow’s sun\\r\\nrise.’ He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his\\r\\nface that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my\\r\\ntemples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit\\r\\nof some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?’ I cried, locking the door, and\\r\\nshaking the key in his face. ‘Punishment has been slow in coming, but it\\r\\nhas overtaken you at last.’ I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He\\r\\nwould have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘Would you murder me?’ he stammered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘There is no murder,’ I answered. ‘Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\\r\\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\\r\\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\\r\\nharem.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘It was not I who killed her father,’ he cried.\\r\\n\\r\\n“‘But it was you who broke her innocent heart,’ I shrieked, thrusting\\r\\nthe box before him. ‘Let the high God judge between us. Choose and\\r\\neat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\\r\\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled\\r\\nby chance.’\\r\\n\\r\\n“He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\\r\\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed\\r\\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or\\r\\nmore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I\\r\\never forget the look which came over his face when the first warning\\r\\npangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw\\r\\nit, and held Lucy’s marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for\\r\\na moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain\\r\\ncontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\\r\\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\\r\\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\\r\\nwas no movement. He was dead!\\r\\n\\r\\n“The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of\\r\\nit. I don’t know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the\\r\\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police\\r\\nupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered\\r\\na German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it\\r\\nwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must\\r\\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle\\r\\nthe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on\\r\\na convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found\\r\\nthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I\\r\\nhad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which\\r\\nI usually kept Lucy’s ring, and found that it was not there. I was\\r\\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.\\r\\nThinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber’s\\r\\nbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly\\r\\nup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose\\r\\nthe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\\r\\npolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\\r\\nsuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\\r\\n\\r\\n“That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\\r\\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier’s debt. I knew\\r\\nthat he was staying at Halliday’s Private Hotel, and I hung about all\\r\\nday, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something when\\r\\nDrebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson,\\r\\nand always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying\\r\\nindoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window\\r\\nof his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders\\r\\nwhich were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into\\r\\nhis room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the\\r\\nhour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long\\r\\nbefore. I described Drebber’s death to him, and I gave him the same\\r\\nchoice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of\\r\\nsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my\\r\\nthroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been\\r\\nthe same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty\\r\\nhand to pick out anything but the poison.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have little more to say, and it’s as well, for I am about done up.\\r\\nI went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\\r\\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\\r\\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\\r\\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B,\\r\\nBaker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I\\r\\nknew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly\\r\\nsnackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That’s the whole of my story,\\r\\ngentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am\\r\\njust as much an officer of justice as you are.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSo thrilling had the man’s narrative been, and his manner was so\\r\\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\\r\\ndetectives, _blasé_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\\r\\nbe keenly interested in the man’s story. When he finished we sat for\\r\\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching\\r\\nof Lestrade’s pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\\r\\naccount.\\r\\n\\r\\n“There is only one point on which I should like a little more\\r\\ninformation,” Sherlock Holmes said at last. “Who was your accomplice who\\r\\ncame for the ring which I advertised?”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. “I can tell my own secrets,”\\r\\n he said, “but I don’t get other people into trouble. I saw your\\r\\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\\r\\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you’ll\\r\\nown he did it smartly.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not a doubt of that,” said Holmes heartily.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now, gentlemen,” the Inspector remarked gravely, “the forms of the law\\r\\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\\r\\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will\\r\\nbe responsible for him.” He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson\\r\\nHope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our\\r\\nway out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\\r\\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\\r\\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\\r\\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would\\r\\nbe meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\\r\\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\\r\\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able\\r\\nin his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,” Holmes remarked, as\\r\\nwe chatted it over next evening. “Where will their grand advertisement\\r\\nbe now?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see that they had very much to do with his capture,” I\\r\\nanswered.\\r\\n\\r\\n“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,” returned my\\r\\ncompanion, bitterly. “The question is, what can you make people believe\\r\\nthat you have done. Never mind,” he continued, more brightly, after a\\r\\npause. “I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\\r\\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\\r\\nwere several most instructive points about it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Simple!” I ejaculated.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,” said Sherlock\\r\\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. “The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\\r\\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able\\r\\nto lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\\r\\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\\r\\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\\r\\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\\r\\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\\r\\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\\r\\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I confess,” said I, “that I do not quite follow you.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\\r\\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\\r\\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\\r\\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\\r\\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\\r\\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\\r\\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\\r\\nbackwards, or analytically.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I understand,” said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\\r\\nfind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\\r\\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached\\r\\nthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\\r\\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I\\r\\nhave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,\\r\\nI ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I\\r\\nsatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the\\r\\nnarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably\\r\\nless wide than a gentleman’s brougham.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\\r\\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\\r\\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\\r\\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\\r\\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which\\r\\nis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\\r\\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice\\r\\nhas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\\r\\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\\r\\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\\r\\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by\\r\\nthe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was\\r\\nformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,\\r\\none remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his\\r\\nstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and\\r\\nelegant impression left by his boots.\\r\\n\\r\\n“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted\\r\\nman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\\r\\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but the\\r\\nagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his\\r\\nfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any\\r\\nsudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their\\r\\nfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a slightly sour\\r\\nsmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon\\r\\nhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred\\r\\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\\r\\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.\\r\\nDo not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\\r\\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.\\r\\nThe cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will\\r\\noccur at once to any toxicologist.\\r\\n\\r\\n“And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\\r\\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\\r\\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.\\r\\nI was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\\r\\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\\r\\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\\r\\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\\r\\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\\r\\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\\r\\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\\r\\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\\r\\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\\r\\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\\r\\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\\r\\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber’s former career. He\\r\\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\\r\\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer’s height, and furnished me\\r\\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length\\r\\nof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no\\r\\nsigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst\\r\\nfrom the murderer’s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the\\r\\ntrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that\\r\\nany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through\\r\\nemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\\r\\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\\r\\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\\r\\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\\r\\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\\r\\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\\r\\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\\r\\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\\r\\nsecure the murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\\r\\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\\r\\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered\\r\\non in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\\r\\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\\r\\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\\r\\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\\r\\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished\\r\\nto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than\\r\\nto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\\r\\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\\r\\nMetropolis.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to\\r\\nbe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be\\r\\nlikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at\\r\\nleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose\\r\\nthat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name\\r\\nin a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized\\r\\nmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every\\r\\ncab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.\\r\\nHow well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are\\r\\nstill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an\\r\\nincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\\r\\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\\r\\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\\r\\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\\r\\nor flaw.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It is wonderful!” I cried. “Your merits should be publicly recognized.\\r\\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won’t, I will for\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“You may do what you like, Doctor,” he answered. “See here!” he\\r\\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, “look at this!”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was\\r\\ndevoted to the case in question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The public,” it said, “have lost a sensational treat through the sudden\\r\\ndeath of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch\\r\\nDrebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will\\r\\nprobably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority\\r\\nthat the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in\\r\\nwhich love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims\\r\\nbelonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the\\r\\ndeceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had\\r\\nno other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner\\r\\nthe efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson\\r\\nto all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at\\r\\nhome, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret\\r\\nthat the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known\\r\\nScotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was\\r\\napprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\\r\\nwho has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective\\r\\nline, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some\\r\\ndegree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort\\r\\nwill be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their\\r\\nservices.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t I tell you so when we started?” cried Sherlock Holmes with a\\r\\nlaugh. “That’s the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\\r\\ntestimonial!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Never mind,” I answered, “I have all the facts in my journal, and the\\r\\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented\\r\\nby the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser--\\r\\n\\r\\n            “‘Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\\r\\n       Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.’”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nORIGINAL TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 1: Frontispiece, with the caption: “He examined with his glass\\r\\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\\r\\nminute exactness.” (_Page_ 23.)]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Footnote 2: “JOHN H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification\\r\\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\\r\\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\\r\\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation’s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\\r\\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\\r\\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\\r\\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\\r\\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\\r\\n     Chief Executive and Director\\r\\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\r\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\r\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\n\\r\\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n'"
